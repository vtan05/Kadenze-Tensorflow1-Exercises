me today this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what's going on and especially how poor she do as president in these very very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism even her former secret service agent who's seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and i will deliver that speech very very soon but today there's only one thing to discuss the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since sep tember eleventh and the worst mass shooting in our country's history so many people since i mean just hard to believe but just so many people dead so many people gravely injured so much carnage such a disgrace sahara is beyond description the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated and they will be forever likewise our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated we express our deepest sympathies to the victims the wounded and their families we mourn as one people for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this thank you our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community they have been through something that nobody could ever experience this is a very dark moment in america's history a radical islamic terrorists targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country we need to respond to this attack in america as one united people with force purpose and determination but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly we're not acting clearly we're not talking clearly we've got problems if we don't get tough and if we don't get smart and fast we're not going to have our country anymore there will be nothing absolutely nothing left the killer whose name i will not use or ever say i was born in afghan of afghan parents who immigrated to the united states his father published support for the afghan taliban regime which murders those who don't share its radical views and they murdered plenty the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here that is a fact and it's a fact we need to talk about we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly we have an incompetent administration and if i'm elected president that will not change i will tell you that will not change over the next four years we have an administration that will not change but if i get in there it's going to change and it's going to change quickly we're going from totally incompetent to just the opposite believe me thank you with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore we have to address these issues head-on i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great scorn and hank but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so and although the pauses temporary we must find out what is going on we have to do it it will be lifted this band when and as a nation we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country they are pouring in and we don't know what we're doing the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons now any class it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states and its as he or she deems appropriate hopefully it's he in this case thank you i will use this power to protect the american people when i'm elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats after a full day and by the way we have no choice after full and partial and long really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions remember this radical islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-american i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people christian people jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence this is not just a national security issue it's a quality of life issue if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans women and children gay and straight jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores and is coming with these people folks it's coming we're importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people were letting into america all of the september eleven hijackers were issued visas large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis the boston bombers came here through political asylum the mail shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife the other terrorists from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly fivefold five fault in just one year according to pew research ninety-nine percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law we admit many more and that's just the way it is we admit many more from other countries in the region and i'll tell you what they share these oppressive views and values we want to remain a free and open society then and if we do then we have to control our borders we have to control and we have to control them now not later right now yeah i don't know if you know this but just a few weeks before san bernardino the slaughter that's all it was a slaughter hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam here is what she said exact quote muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism that is hillary clinton so she says the solution is to ban guns they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans abolishing the second amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns no good not going to happen folks not gonna happen not gonna happen like she wants to take away americans guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us let them come into the country we don't have guns let them come in let them have all the fun they want i will be meeting with the nra which has given me the earliest endorsement in a presidential race to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror i will be always defending the second amendment thank you the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america and allowed to grow overseas and it is growing in fact hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic in the immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life when it comes to radical islamic terrorism ignorance is not bliss its deadly totally deadly the obama administration with the support of hillary clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have just no intelligence gathering information we need this information so badly and he stopped it we don't have the support we don't have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job they are not being allowed to do their job and they can do it well better than anybody we need a new leader we need a new leader fast thank you they have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else i refuse to be politically correct i want to do the right thing i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again the days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if i'm elected as president i will give our intelligence community law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks and they don't have those tools now we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none second to none that includes medical operation between state local and federal officials and with our allies very importantly i will have an attorney general a director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right not like it is right now it's not right we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states in september 11 nearly a year ago the senate subcommittee as president obama's department of justice state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states these departments refused to comply nobody even knows why they refused to comply president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since sep tember 11 so important the public has a right to know how these people got here how they came onto this great land why are they here we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs very simple we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america not complicated every and and just think of this take a look every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases just a single event and just one person can you imagine what they'll do in large groups which were allowing now to come here truly our president doesn't know what he's doing he's failed us and he's failed us badly and under his leadership this situation will not get any better it will only get worse and i've been saying that for a long time each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security in fact clinton state department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas having learned nothing from these attacks she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a five hundred percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country tell me tell me how stupid is that this could be a better bigger more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was all together under the clinton plan you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them what to relieve order to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children not only their children by the way they're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system system - really - screen we're not screening people so why don't we have an effective screening system we don't were being left at all over the world the bird is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for a current population including the many poor people already living here we have cities we have inner cities we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states we don't know who they are they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership in which case they're out of here what i want what i want is common sense i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values that's a choice i put before the american people a mainstream in a great immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interest that's all it is we've got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we've got to do it now because later is too late going to be too late for our country the media talks about homegrown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that's a very very important term a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it our imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it yes there are many radicalize people already inside a country as a result of poor policies of the past but the whole point is that we will be much much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem and that's what they're doing we're letting all of these people hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have for instance the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had and its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father was supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth why would we admit people who support violent hatred hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gate community as long as she continued - support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women gays and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values she can't have it both ways she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to impress these same communities how does this kind of immigration make our lives better how does this kind of immigration make our country better why does hillary clinton want to bring people in invest numbers who reject our values why explain ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the l be and lgbt community donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words i will tell you who the better friend is and someday i believe that will be proven out bigley and by the way the lbgt community is just what's happened to them is just so said and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is to disgrace to that community i will tell you right now clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women and they murder gays i don't want them in our country immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities every single one of them america is already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth anybody in the world four times more at least because we don't even know who's coming in and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny not surprisingly wages for our workers haven't budged in almost 20 years you wonder why we get the crowds you wonder why we get this tremendous support you wonder why i've got more votes than any republican in any primary and the history of the republican party take a look at that take a look at your security but take a look at the wages for 18 years they've been stagnant they've even gone down so whether it's a matter of national security or financial security we can't afford to keep on going like this cannot afford it we are 19 trillion dollars in debt and no longer have any options are communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief this is not an act of offense against anyone it's really an act of defense i want us all all of us to work together we have to form a partnership with our muslim communities we have muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership now the muslim community so importantly they have to work with us they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith i want to fix our schools i want to fix our bridges and our jobs market we're going to have it rock it again we're going to make great trade deals but i want every american to succeed including muslims but the muslims have to work with us they have to work with us they know what's going on they know that he was bad they knew the people in san bernardino were bad but you know what they didn't turn them in and we had death and destruction hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens i want to protect our citizens all of our citizens the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault in san bernardino as an example people who know what was going on they knew exactly what they use the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it they said all we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don't get in trouble we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what if any is their immigration status we have to know and we have to know fast we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with we need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us and we have an attack and people die these people have to have consequences big consequences america must do more much more to protect its citizens especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation as you just saw in orlando it also means we must change our foreign policy the decision to overthrow the regime in libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before these actions along with our disasters iran deal have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation-building no more nation-building it's never going to work and by the way we've spent almost five trillion dollars over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been a complete and total disaster were further away now that we were 15 years ago for instance the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya that mission helped unleash isis on a new cotton i've said nato needs to change his focus and stop terrorism we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorists since i've raised that criticism and it's okay i've got no credit for it but these are minor details nato has since announced a new initiative front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war we've tried it president obama's way doesn't work he gave the world his apology tour we got isis and many other problems in return that's what we got remember the famous apology to our way sorry for everything i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders wherever they come from wherever they were born i don't care all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected thank you we're going to be tough and we're going to be smart and went to do it right america will be a tolerant and open society america will also be a safe society we will protect our borders at home we will defeat isis overseas we have no choice we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety we will make america rich again we will make america safe again good evening thank you very much i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel i'm a newcomer to politics but not to back in the jewish state in 2001 weeks after the attacks on new york city and on washington and frankly the attacks on all of us attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalist mayor rudy giuliani visitors israel to show solidarity with terror victims i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel one hundred percent in spring of 2004 at the height of the violence in the gaza strip i was the grand marshal of the 40 is salute to israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel many people turned down this honor i did not i took the risk and i'm glad i did but i didn't come here tonight to pander to you about israel that's what politicians do all talk no action believe me i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally are unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother the only democracy in the middle east this state of israel thank you my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous thank you thank you i have been in business a long time i know deal making and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for america for israel and for the whole of the middle east the problem here is fundamental we have rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return i've studied this issue in great detail i would say actually greater by far than anybody else believe me oh believe me yeah and it's a bad deal the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it because already you know as you know it has the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock and of course they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them the deal doesn't even require a ran to dismantle its military nuclear capability yes it places limits on its military nuclear program for all the a certain number of years but when those restrictions expire a red will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad iran's behavior is terrible terrible situation that we are all placed in an especially israel when i'm president i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to around first we will stand up to iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region iran is a very big problem and will continue to be but if i'm not elected president i know how to deal with trouble and believe me that's why i'm going to be elected president folks and we are leading in every poll remember that place iran is the problem in iraq a problem in syria a problem in lebanon a problem in yemen and will be a very very major problem for saudi arabia literally every day around provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states hizbollah lebanon received and i'll tell you what it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons anti-aircraft weapons and gps systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have now they're in syria tried to establish another front against israel from the serious side of the golan heights in gaza iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad and in the west bank they're openly offering palestinians seven thousand dollars per terror attack and thirty thousand dollars for every palestinian terrorists home that's been destroyed a deplorable deplorable situation iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more for the many horrible acts of terror secondly we will totally dismantle iran's global terror network which is big and powerful but not powerful like us miranda seated terror groups all over the world during the last five years a red has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents they've got terrorist cells everywhere including in the western hemisphere very close to home iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach believe me believe me third at the very least we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract and force before folks believe me iran has already since the deal is in place test fired ballistic missiles three times those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states and we're not going to let that happen we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to thank you you want to hear something really shocking as many of the great people in this room know painted on those missions in both hebrew and farsi where the words israel must be wiped off the face of the earth you can forget that yeah what kind of demented minds right that in hebrew and here's another you talk about twisted here's another twisted part testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made the deal is silent on test mrs. but those has to violate the united nations security council resolutions the problem is no one has done anything about it which brings me to my next point the utter weakness and in the united nations is not a friend of democracy it's not a friend to freedom it's not a friend even to the united states of america where as you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to israel with president obama in his final year yeah yeah he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel believe me believe me and you know it and you know it better than anybody so with the president and his final year discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine let me be clear an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto which i will use this president one hundred percent when people ask why it's because that's not how you make a deal deals are made when parties come together they come to a table and they negotiate each side let's give up something its values i mean we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires that's what a deal is a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine we bring together a group of people that come up with something that's not going to happen with the united nations it will only further very importantly it will only further d legitimatize israel it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel it's not going to happen folks and further it would reward palestinian terrorism because every day they're stabbing israelis and even americans just last week american taylor al enforce a west point grad phenomenal young person who served in iraq and afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding palestinian you don't reward behavior like that you can not do it yeah there's only one way you treat that kind of behavior you have to confront it so it's not up to the united nations to pollute to really go with the solution it's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves they have no choice they have to do it themselves or will never hold up anyway the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling israel that it must be and and really that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to israel to anything in the area it's so preposterous we're not when i'm president believe me i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state it will be vetoed one hundred percent you see i know about deal-making that's what i do i wrote the art of the deal one of the best-selling all time and i mean seriously i'm saying one up because i'll be criticized azure i say thee so i'm going to be very diplomatic one of i'll be criticized i think it is number one but why take a chance one of the all-time best-selling books about deals and deal-making to make a great deal you need to willing participants we know israel is willing to deal israel has been trying right israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years you had camp david in two thousand where prime minister brock made an incredible offer maybe even too generous arafat rejected in 2008 prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer the palestinian authority rejected it also then john kerry tried to come up with afraid work and a bus didn't even respond not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america they didn't even respond when i become president the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end thank you and when i say something i mean it i mean i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately i have known for many years and will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region meanwhile every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and to hate the juice it has to stop when you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes little kids want to be firefighters when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes little kids want to be athletes and movie stars in palestinian society the heroes are those who murder juice we can't let this continue we can't let this happen any longer you you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as borders glorifying terrorist is a tremendous barrier to piece it is a horrible horrible way to think it's a barrier that can't be broken that will end and it'll end soon believe me in palestinian textbooks and mods you've got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace they've got to go out and they've got to start this educational process they have to end education of hatred they have to end it and now there is no moral equivalency israel does not name public squares after terrorists israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians you see what president obama gets wrong about deal-making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our and you see that happening all the time that pattern practice by the president and his administration including former secretary of state hillary clinton who is a total disaster by the way she and president obama have treated israel very very battery but it's repeated itself over and over again and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america we saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community it didn't happen president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue but it's precisely the opposite that happens already half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half so it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the united states will get it solved one way or the other we will get it soft but when the united states says with israel the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially that's what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally this state of israel the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely totally unbreakable they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel they must do that and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a i love the people in this room i love israel i love israel i've been with israel so long in terms of i've received some of my greatest honors from israel my father before me incredible my daughter ivanka is about to in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i'm concerned so i want to thank you very much this has been a truly great honor thank you everybody thank good afternoon good afternoon thank you very much thank you very much great to be here in virginia thank you all for being here i it's an extraordinary troubling time for our country and the reason it's so troubling is that we have a nation that today feels more divided than any time in my lifetime and we are divided in large measure because our leaders are not providing the type of clarity about what are the important priorities that the people want our country to be pursuing the first and most important thing to me not only as a governor but more importantly as a husband and a father is the safety and the security of my family and i respect you feel the same way and that safety and security is not just about being safe and secure from threats outside this country it's about making sure that we're safe and secure from threats of violence from within our country as well we need a president who once again we'll put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency in this country yeah are police officers the men and women who stand each day to protect us need to understand that the president of the united states and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt not always believed that what they've done is somehow wrong we need to stand behind the men and women in blue in this country i spent seven years as a member of law enforcement the united states attorney in new jersey and during those years the president i served made it very clear to us that our first job was to protect the safety and security of the american people and that every other priority while important fell in behind that we need once again to have a president who puts the safety and security of our citizens first and does not blink or hesitate to take the strong action that needs to be taken to make sure that those both at home and around the world though that wallace this will not be tolerated from anyone no matter how powerful or lack of power that those people may have one order needs to be the first priority once again are in our country yeah and in this coming election there can be little question about where law and order stands and where wallace stance the fact is that we have the spectacle last week of watching a director of the fbi twice in one week repeatedly say that the democratic nominee for president lied to the american people that the democratic nominee for president put her own political convenience ahead of the safety and security of the american people and fbi director who said that the repeated assurances that mrs. clinton has given us over the course of the last year regarding her email scandal in fact in every material way were false that's not a person who will stand for the rule of law that's a personal stand for the rule of her and that's not what we need the white house yeah and everyone who's involved in law enforcement should be rightfully concerned if you have a president who puts the rule of law behind their own personal interests i support donald trump and have for quite some time because i know that he will be the type of president who will put the rule of law first we'll make sure that the laws enforced aggressively and appropriately and it will put people in his administration to understand that the rules in this country and the laws of this country apply to everyone not just the least power full but also the most powerful they apply to everyone and so i am grateful and happy that you are here today to lend your voices to that effort it's also listen listen to what these candidates have to say listen how donald trump will stand up not only for those who serve today in law enforcement but also for the men and women who have served in our military they deserve much better than what this administration is given yeah that we make that will mean making tough decisions that will mean breaking some china all throughout the government it will mean stopping it will mean stopping this pattern of accepting less than the best for the people of this country we need someone who has always demand that the best from everyone who has worked for him and with him and it will place the interest of the american people first and foremost that is the person who is going to be our republican nominee next week and is the person who i firmly believe will serve his country best as the next president united states we need to make sure that we go out there and fight as hard as we can to make that happen there will be no could have been should have ben's on the day after the election it's going to be we did it we fought for it we stood up and we took our country back to one order once again yeah seven years i stood as us attorney i made sure that justice was both blind and fair and we need to make sure that that returns to our country it has left it in this administration and we need to restore it and that's why i'm so proud to be with the man that's here and you're going to hear from a few minutes today because he is someone who will make sure that he absolutely gives you the confidence every night when you put your head on the pillow that his number one priority will be the safety and security of your family thanks so much for being here today it's great to see all of you again yeah ladies and gentlemen please welcome the chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs congressman jeff miller the great thing about a military town like virginia beach's that there are folks that understand what it means to take care of those that have worn the uniform of this nation unfortunately in recent years your government has not done the job that it's supposed to do for those who have served this nation it's not for a lack of money it's not for a lack of resources nor manpower the department of veterans affairs budget has quadrupled since 2001 they have almost 350,000 employees but the same department lurches back and forth every single day from scandal to scandal and veterans continue to pay the price what's missing is leadership at the top as a candidate barack obama promised veterans the moon as the president of the united states he has not delivered his department of veterans affairs has become a model of government dysfunction what's worse is he refuses to defend a law that he himself signed that would give the secretary of the department of veterans affairs the ability to fire those that have done veterans wrong yeah what america needs a commander-in-chief that understands the problem that faces the veterans of today and is committed to do and what it takes to solve the problems whatever it takes we won't get that from a career bureaucrat like hillary clinton who said who is so painfully out of touch with the veteran community that she thinks even though veterans 40 of them at least in phoenix waited on a waitlist and died she thinks that it's been over-exaggerated she can't solve the problems because she doesn't believe that there are any problems out there and if she ends up back in the white house which she won't but if she ended up back in the white house we would continue to see scandal after scandal within the department of veterans affairs but donald trump donald trump knows the challenges that face america's veterans today he has the experience and the leadership that is necessary to boldly reform the department of veterans affairs he's built a fantastic business one that's known all over the globe that's precisely the type of person that we need to boldly reform the department of veterans affairs and unlike hillary clinton donald trump doesn't view va's problems as a fantasy that's been created by the opposition party he knows that they're real and he has a plan to fix them and that's what we're going to hear about today ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to introduce to you the next president of the united states donald j haha thank you what a great group thank you very much well i'd like to thank chairman jeff miller is terrific guy and on behalf of all of those who have served this country in military uniform and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our truly great veterans thank you very much chef i appreciate it before going further today however i'd like to first address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform our police offices we love our police officers thank you that's very nice thank you police officers rush into danger every single day to protect our communities and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism they serve thousands of lives every year performed countless public services every day and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report but i want our nation's police to know that we thank you from the bottom of our heart and we support you and we will always always always stand with you the attack on our dallas police is an attack on our country our whole nation is in mourning and will be for a very long time yet we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty very big rise america's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos and the destruction of our country as we know it we must remember the police are needed the most where crime is the highest politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable americans it's time for our hostility against terror police and against all members of law enforcement to end and end immediately right now we went through an ugly chapter in our history during vietnam when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas for too many police today that is their daily reality at the same time the tragic deaths in louisiana and minnesota make clear that the work must be done to ensure and a lot of work that americans feel that their safety is protected have to do it we have to get better better sharper smarter we were all disturbed by the images that we saw we must discuss as well the on going to test raphy of crime in our inner cities our inner cities are rife with crime according to the chicago tribune there has already been more than 2,000 2,000 shooting victims in chicago alone this year this epidemic of violence destroys lives destroys communities and destroys opportunity for young americans violent crime has increased in cities across america the new york times described the startling rise and murders in our major cities brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into virginia and maryland too many americans are trapped in fear violence and poverty our inner cities have been left totally behind and i'm going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home a safe school and a safe community yeah we must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country one hundred percent we will cease to have a country hillary clinton on the other hand is weak ineffective pandering and as proven by her recent email scandal which was an embarrassment not only to her but to the entire nation as a whole she's either a liar or grossly incompetent one of the other very simple personally it's probably both not only am i the law and order candidate but i'm also the candidate of compassion believe it the candidate of compassion but you can have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of our country every kid in america should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood without harm everyone will be protected equally and treated justly without prejudice we will be tough we will be smart we will be fair and we will protect all americans yeah without safety we have nothing it's the job of the next president to make america safe again for everyone everyone that promise of protection must include taking care of every last veteran which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the horrible attack in dallas the men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of america now is the time to follow their example of unity public service and selfless devotion to our nation we made a promise and we have to honor the promise that we made to these great heroes you defend america and america will defend thank you but that promise has been broken by our politicians like so many other promises our country is made not only to its veterans but two its citizens as a whole president obama has allowed our veterans affairs health care all systems really denied them the help and the support and willie has to do it we have to get on the ball we have to do it right hillary clinton recently said of the va scandal that it's not been as widespread as it's been made out to be that's a quote she actually thinks that the veterans health administration is well run that's because she's been part of this rigged system for a long time perhaps it's easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they're being paid millions of dollars to read a teleprompter speeches to wall street executives instead of spending time with real people in real pain the disconnect the disconnected america's deep there are two americas the ruling class and the groups of favors and then everyone else the va scandals that have occurred on this administration's watch are widespread and totally inexcusable an internal memo from the senior va officials describes quote lawlessness and chaos at the veterans health administration including the payments of six billion dollars a year in violation of federal contracting rules the memo also says they waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws and warns that these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to america's great veterans and you know it and you're singing even the white house's own deputy chiefs f described quote significant and chronic systemic failures in veterans affairs including a corrosive culture that has led to personal problems across the department with poor management and a history of retaliation against employees who raised issues and very good issues he said he said there is a lack of accountability across all grade levels on that is correct 40 veterans just as an example have died waiting for karen things 40 different va facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times a va employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff as was a convicted sex offender the va spent eight million dollars on solar panels girls solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be tearing it down in the very near future the st. cloud minnesota va built a 2.3 million dollar wind turbine in april that hasn't supplied power since 2012 can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full thank you thank you most of those responsible have still not been held to account fixing this corruption will be one of my many and really highest priorities and believe me it will happen i'm really good at things like that it will be fixed and that begins with a simple promise every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care every better veteran should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctrine clinics weather at a va facility or at a private medical center we must extend this right to all veterans not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days or live more than 40 miles from the va hospital which is unfortunately the current and wrong policy this promise includes guaranteed access to the best available health care services for our female veterans they're not being treated right we must also do more to help our veterans find jobs every year large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas and across the border to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our veterans veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect they fought hard to protect us they are going to comforts in a trump administration they will be they will be a part of america first it will be america first from now on america first yeah yeah thank you thank you veteran's health care must also include the best mental health care a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day especially our older veterans this is a national tragedy that's not talked about the evidence shows that our veterans are in the system receiving care they are much less likely to take their own lives than veterans outside of this horrible horrible and very unfair system that is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the va while ensuring that veterans can access private mental health care as well have to do it have to do we have no choice america must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large this is for everyone this includes expanding the number of facilities integrating primary care and mental health care professionals reforming confinement rules very important and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones to the care and of the care they need especially in the many emergencies that were having all over the country and doing nothing whatsoever about it yeah one of the most important reforms we can make his accountability right now when va employees fail our veterans you can't discipline them that's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform have to do it we like it we don't like it we have to do it it's time in fact employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions in 2014 the va awarded a 142 million dollars in bonuses to employees including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the denver va hospital that was more than 1 billion dollars over budget to other via executives signed abuse and they really abused it was terrible abuse their authority to obtain four hundred thousand dollars in relocation benefits currently a scandal and we're doing nothing about it doesn't have to be this way as veterans affair chairman jeff miller just said and will say all the time the va is not sacred the veteran is sacred the veteran is yeah thank you here is my 10-step plan to ensure quality timely care for every single veteran in america one i will appoint a secretary of veterans affair who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the va and this will be a person of great competence this will not be a political hack the secretary soul mandate will be to serve our veterans are bureaucrats not politicians but veterans amazingly president obama's va secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at disneyland so what's wrong with that right - i'm going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail are veterans or breach the public trust 3 i'm going to ask congress to pass legislation that ensures the secretary of veterans affairs has the authority to remove her discipline any employee who risks the health safety or well-being appoint a commission to investigate all of the wrongdoing at the va and then present those findings to congress as the basis for bold legislative reform why i'm going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the va have their jobs protected and are put in line for serious promotions if they continue to do great work yeah i will create a private white house hotline that is really and so importantly going to be answered by a real person actually a person not a computer that picks up and i don't take place 24 hours a day to ensure that no valid complaint about the va and it's wrongdoing falls through the cracks i will instruct my staff that have a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me and i will pick up the phone and fix it myself if i have to believe thank you seven we are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money wasting money the bonuses of money that's being paid out and start giving bonuses to people for improving service saving lives and cutting waste if an employer finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates really better outcomes for our veterans that a small responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to the taxpayers and it will be a lot yeah we are going to reform our visa programs to ensure american veterans are in the front not the back of a line 9 we're going to increase the number of mental health care facilities and professionals and increase the outreach to veterans outside of the system of which there are many 10 we are going to ensure every veteran in america has the choice to seek care at the veterans administration or to seek private medical care paid for by our government never again will we allow a veteran to suffer die waiting for care they so richly deserve these are our great people we need to clean out the corruption in government and hillary clinton will never be able to do it she's incompetent and has proven time and time again that she doesn't have what it takes doesn't have it crooked hillary clinton yeah yeah sadly sadly crooked hillary clinton is the secretary of the status quo and wherever hillary clinton goes corruption and scandal follow just look at her life our country needs change and she will never give us change never ever ever the fact is she helped create are rigged system you saw that last week hillary clinton's america is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment so true and she couldn't care less despite what she says she couldn't carrots the rig system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of us everybody in this room everybody in this country at risk hillary clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials what you did was so wrong what other people did far less and they're paying a tremendous price right now in other words she was willing to risk our farm enemies reading your emails as long as the voting american public could not her conduct was willful intentional and unlawful and to repeated false statements about her condom prove that she was fully aware of her guilt she knew it she's probably the most surprised person that she was able to get away with it this was not just extreme carelessness with classified material which is still totally disqualified this is calculated deliberate premeditated misconduct followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to congress the media and the american people in fact when the fbi interviewed her for only three hours during the fourth of july weekend her interview was not recorded and she was amazingly not even under oath you didn't know that she carried out her dangers email scheme at the same time as her bad judgment and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing isis all across the world afterwards as a further demonstration of guilt hillary clinton erased more than 30,000 emails as part of a cover-up tell reason part of a cover hard to believe what's going on with our country the fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment to me it is the greatest accomplishment when thinking about your email destruction let's not forget many foreign and corporate entities and other special interests with business before hillary clinton state department were making massive financial contributions folks these contributions were made to both the clinton foundation and to the clintons directly if elected hillary clinton would become the first president of the united states who wouldn't be able to pass a background check she would not be able just look at what the fbi director said about her misconduct is a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country clearly hillary clinton thinks she's above the law come november the american people will show her that she is thank you the decades of decay division in decline will come to an end rapidly the years of america's greatness will return we are going to become for the first time in a long time one united country we're going to make america great again and safe again for all americans we will dream big and bold and daring things once more once more we're going to go big we're going to go great you can be so proud of your country let me conclude by paying tribute to every single american here who has served this country and most especially those who gave the ultimate thank you thank you yeah our debt to them is eternal and everlasting we are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have thought for us we will be a safe strong and proud country again ladies and gentlemen thank you very much yeah yeah the united states of america donald trump thank you very much we had an amazing convention that was one of the best i think it was one of the best ever in terms in terms of enthusiasm in terms of i think what it represents getting our word out ivanka was incredible last night you didn't put so many of the speakers were so amazing and ground setting i mean really ground setting we were it was just something very very special we're even getting good marks and television can you believe it hard to believe they will change know that way but it has been it has been just an incredible four days i want to thank the people of cleveland and the people of ohio because it's i mean what what they've done you know we read two three weeks ago this is going to be horrible we're going to have riots we're gonna have problems and everything was a problem a problem this was probably one of the most peaceful one of the most beautiful one of the most love filled conventions in the history of conventions and when they talk about unity i want to tell you that was unity that was your day right i saw you last night that was unity that was amazing and the party has just come together the party has come together and the few people that aren't there it's okay you know you gotta understand iran is an outsider i didn't want anybody now i have guys like mike pence sent me this isn't supposed to happen see now if i don't win i'm going to blame i right we have to play my but we want to thank a number of people because in in particular we're going to leave out some because that always happens and it's very said the set i'm a real estate guy i build buildings and i build things i want to tell you that was the most beautiful set i think i've ever seen not only for conventions but for anything and the folks that worked on that especially the carpenters the electrician's you know we forget about we forget about this stuff no sheet rockers were up there they did a heck of a job i see you're gonna wrap that sheetrock and he said yes mr. trump we just cut and i said i know what you do but you don't see it very much we have our chairman from new york i see right over there my man my leader right we're gonna win new york wasn't trying to win new york you know we win new york it's over right it's over thank you chairman i really appreciate it so a few of the people harold hamm is here where's harold he's around here so look at her again oh boy you talk about money i yeah you know barry switzer the great football coach was super bowl one national championship and i guess he's harold's best friend or one of them so he came up to my office and he's sitting there is you know mr. trump peril is one of the great energy tycoons but more importantly from our standpoint one of the people that really understand energy better than anybody else you know we hired these consultants they don't know what they're doing they were any good they'd be worth ten billion dollars okay but harold is one of the the really knowledgeable people and energy and barry switzer and he's a tough cookie and a good guy but a tough cookie he said you know mr. trump that harold hamm he's my friend but these other companies they go out and they spend millions of dollars looking for oil that guy takes a straw puts it the ground and oil pours out of that's the kind of a guy we want telling us about energy right arrow and you made a great speech the other night great to have we want the real players right we don't want the consultants we don't want the guys that he hires we want him so harold great did you hear i didn't know you'd be here i appreciate it and your speech was stuart's like by the way we also have and i think very important jeff sessions who may or may not be here still but i want to tell you he was the first one mikey was right at the beginning and he's so highly respected and honestly ted cruz has so much respect for jeff sessions and everybody knew that jeff sessions was going to be with that cruise during the campaign and you have said you know i've never seen anything like what's happening you've got a movement going and he was really the first big big player you are sending a highly respected by everybody one of the really smart people and low key i like that every once in a while you know that low key genes well done ally i don't know about do it that way why don't you try doing it this way i said that's genius every once in a while we have people like that right but jeff sessions was there right at the beginning and it was a huge upset because when jeff came on everybody thought he was going to just routinely be with ted and frankly he's never endorsed anybody before you know he's not an endorser this is he's called a tough endorsement and he went out any endorsement that was a fantastic thing that has been a great help ever since so jeff sessions i appreciate jeff larson's around here someplace was you have larson he's around here someplace what a job gested rights of course with my superstar i think he's probably on a plane flying to our next meeting this i worked so hard and i said yesterday in front of a small group because we're raising money like it's crazy what's going on and you know the nice thing first of all i put in over 60 million dollars last month i think i put in 3.8 million but we're raising money also for the republican party which is very important and and the beautiful thing i can guarantee these figures but i heard yesterday alone was like three and a half billion dollars from small donors the average donation was just over fifty dollars and we're raising tremendous amount of money from the small doors to me that's more important in a sense i mean harold can write his checks the heralds only one vote right these other people give you fifty bucks but they vote by the millions that's what we want the hell with arrow right but but we have you know just tremendous numbers of people coming in and we're really building up a war chest that's going to be great and i'm continuing to fund my campaign large portions of it and fact i thought i gave two million last month and they said no you actually gave 3.8 i said huh it's always good when you don't even know what you gave and it doesn't matter you know it's nice when they say you gave three . and send it to and i don't even get angry at everybody ready but i'm over 60 million dollars because i said i was going to fund the primers and i didn't know this was gonna happen so i guess we just keep going along right but i'll tell you it's an honor it's an honor and i i hope that i've said this a lot of the television people have come up to me a lot of the actually one very highly respected writer called up and i told the story few times but i said he said what you've done is incredible and this was actually in september they called it the summer of trump and he said what you've done is incredible i said nothing is incredible unless i win and i wasn't talking about the primary he said no no no what you've done is incredible it's been the summer of trump it's down in the history books has never been anything like it bill o'reilly said the greatest single political phenomenon has ever seen in his life a couple of weeks ago did you see that and britt hume said and i'm not so sure britain likes me but he said so but i like him so what happened is they said that i said oh no you don't understand i don't care i don't do anything let's say win and i'm not talking about the primers i mean the whole thing is otherwise what have we done what have we done then i got a call from somebody else a month ago saying the same thing but now it was the summer of trump it was the order of trump it was the christmas of truck it was everything and its really of you because it's a movement what we have going as a movement i was just on the cover of time again this week time magazine is like yeah okay you know i think i was on the cover of time magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months so you tell me which is more important real estate or politics okay that's that's the way is that true harold so i have 64 politics and i have to for real estate or whatever they put me on for but it's been it's been amazing but i said look it really to me that is they said no no believe me what you've done is in the history books there's never been anything like it then i won the primaries is that the same thing this is crazy now you're really in this i said no it doesn't matter unless we be hillary clinton and i mean even more attention i will consider it and i shouldn't say this because you know what if it doesn't work out i could say well i did a good job but it's all hurting myself by saying this if i don't win meaning that final stage beat 17 people because actually 17 including but it was actually 17 because there was one that we don't even talk about who joined to left very quickly one statement he was gone ok and then don't forget hillary had a couple of guys who dropped out and bernie was tough bernie was stuff we're gonna get a lot of the bernie voters by the world because they didn't treat bernie right they didn't treat him i mean i don't know bernie i don't do you know i don't know am i never met him but they didn't treat him right honestly and what happened he ran a very very good campaign and hillary's people just swamped him you're looking at debra wasserman schultz i'll take our rights over her anyday in terms of confidence forget it not for being nice or any of those things who cares i will take rights in terms of confidence over her believe me any day any day you see what she's done to that party so i will tell you that i think we're going to get a lot of his voters because of the trade issue because they understand but because of the trade issue i think we're going to get a lot of their voters so i have to thank rights i want to thank steve king where steve king that's our local steve where steve where thank you see i want to thank some of our security guys first of all the secret services unbelievable yeah they've been hit a little bit over the last couple of years let me tell you these guys are fantastic i'm the best thing that ever happened to the secret service because i go around mark and all these guys i go around saying how great they are they are great these are great great people okay so i want to thank the secret service i want to thank the police of cleveland and cleveland police department the mayor i want to thank i want to thank your police chief he is amazing i don't know if he's here boy he has done some job working working with all of the folks from law enforcement and you heard last night we're gonna be protecting law enforcement they are doing some job so we're going to be protecting them i want to thank any dick was that is any here i want to thank kevin schroeder keith schiller become famous because he's becoming more famous than me i have to thank and and again your police chief has done a fantastic job in cleveland done a fantastic and we have come in terms of some of the folks david gilbert was david david around someplace joe roman chris connor chris kelly these people are all here don't bother you don't have to come up and speak ok beth pony was brian jack brian jack boy brian right want a job you did brian ok that's all now you can leave go to the next location brian go to the next location hillary's trying to pick a vice president as fast as possible because he wants to take away a little of the success that we had at this convention this convention has been a tremendous success you know people if you turn on television you certain you turn on some of the designers meeting you'll see that oh wow this happened and that happened what happened you know somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people there wasn't one person too not one and then they said there may not be unity unity it wasn't one person in the room who was with including the texas delegation right honestly he may have ruined his political career i feel so bad i feel so ben and you know he'll come indoors over the next little while coming into this because he has no choice but i don't want to endorse what differences are make i don't want his endorsement i have such great and i don't want his interest was just dead stay home relax enjoy yourself just a couple of things i knew his speech they gave me a speech i saw exactly what his speech was because when you go up to speak you have to give your speech you know we don't want surprises right so they gave it they came to me they said it's boring speech mr. trump nothing good nothing varies congratulate you on the victory and here's the speech when he got up and the first two sentences he added a sentence in other words he got up and he added a sentence which could have been viewed as a nasty thing in terms of what he said because he was implying something which is wrong but that's okay so he took his speech and you're bound by that speech just like you're bound by the pledge bound by the pool so ted cruz took a speech that was done was on the teleprompter said hello then made a statement that wasn't on the speech and then went back to his speech see to me that's dishonorable to me not signing a pledge is dishonorable ok it's the sauna but not a nice thing to do and i talk this way because we're all together we created one of the most successful conventions in the history of conventions and the television ratings for this convention were through the roof i get a kick out of cnn i don't know if this is a successful conviction are don't in the meantime all they talk about is trump in the convention right and i have to tell you milania did a great job what a great school one of those what a great speech and the presentation is still being talked about what a beautiful speech ivanka last night unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable to have that kind of an introduction and tiffany who's never done it the biggest rip she's ever been in front of his probably 22 people in a classroom tiffany was amazing and eric and don i just don't want them running for political office because somebody's going to stay behind and run the business i mean you know we can't go crazy but i get a kick because the ratings on television are through the roof and nobody's gonna want to look up this has nothing to do with politics but maybe there's a little to do nobody's gonna watch this next convention coming hooting who's gonna i'm gonna have a hard time watching her final speech number one i know her too well number two boring exploring very boring oh how about that final speech and our final speech our finals now it wasn't my fault but i think it went like an hour and 25 minutes and the network's didn't know what to do because they had all of their programming big program the local loses a very big factor on television you never ever move your local do they all moved it they said the heck with the local news mike they said we're moving and kimmel and fallon and the show is they all went back a long way because they weren't going to miss this convention i love that you know i love it i knew i said no one was supposed to be off let's keep going but it wasn't my fault what happened what happened is the applause was so long and so crazy it really was i mean if you look at the speech was fine but the applause were longer than this speech so i was it was a base there was great love in that room honestly that was all about unity and we may be missing a couple of people we may be missing just a couple of people and two other things to other things i just to finish with ted because i liked it he's fine again i don't want his endorsement if he gives it i will not accept it just so you understand if you don't i will i will not accept matter honestly he should have done it because nobody cares and he would have been in better shape for four years from now if he's gonna be i don't think i don't see him winning anyway frankly but if he if he did i fine although maybe i'll set up a super back if he decides to run are you allowed to set up a super pac mike if you are the president to fight somebody but but there were two things that he said yesterday were lies ready i didn't start anything with the wife a pack which is very friendly with realistic released a cover story on my wife was as tremendously successful and elegant model and she was on the cover of gq magazine i think it was chi kurit a gq magazine's not exactly penthouse but she was under cover of gq magazine and artsy picture but you know that's what she was a model really successful she didn't need to marry me she's making a lot of money believe me i gotta work hard to get her to marry me wasn't that easy show you think i'm getting so so they released this picture which was you know to the people of the state of utah i love you too i love the people of utah but that's not where you want to necessarily send a risk a picture everybody and you talk about a picture and i don't think they showed that it was gq i don't even think they should they took the gq off they just said they cut all the stuff that so they didn't say it was a magazine cover from you know a reasonably respected magazine and who is melania trump now and i'm saying this just to clear it up because that's what you took it didn't do anything then when i saw somebody tweeted a picture milani and a picture of hiding who i think by the way is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman i have to tell you i think heidi cruz is a great person well i think it's the best thing he's got going in his kids if you want to know fruit in a certain way although he's got good intellect but he doesn't know how to use it and he was a good debater but he didn't do well in the debates against me according to every paul i mean every poll you know just great the better except lost in every single poll and every single debate so that takes care of the hide anything because heidi is a terrific woman but they send out now he said that was a pack we had nothing to do folks a lot of us are political people right we're not babies his people were on the pack so he said we had nothing to do we had this now probably you could trace it down with emails protect pretty smart they don't even said probably just phone calls but look it was the pack with many of his friends it was a cruise super back i think even said well was it really meant for us it was a cruise back it was his people ok so they sent out the first picture please remember that number to his father i don't know his father i am adam wants i think it's a lovely guy i think he's a little again all i did is point out the fact that on the cover of the national enquirer is a picture of hurt him and crazy lee harvey oswald having breakfast now ted never denied that it was his father and study said donald trump i had nothing to do with it this was a magazine that frankly in many respects should be very respected they got oj they got edwards they got this i mean if that was the new york times they would have gotten pulitzer prizes for their reporting i've always said why didn't the national enquirer get the pulitzer prize for edwards and oj simpson and all of these things but anyway so they have a picture an old picture having breakfast with lee harvey us now nothing is i'm not saying anything they said and here's how the process takes lester so this had nothing to do with me except i might have pointed it out but it had nothing to do with me i have no control over anything i might appointed but they never deny did anybody ever deny that was the father they're not saying oh that wasn't really my father and slow hard to do just look like him so here's the story the press takes that they say donald trump and his conspiracy theories he went out and said his father was with lee harvey oswald and he assassinated the president why did i do so - thanks those with the two points so are those two points he said about the endorsement yet and and i just had cleared up i think i'm doing the right thing and doing it but i have to do it number one the hiding thing you understand now number two i know nothing about his father i know nothing about lee harvey oswald but there was a picture on the front page of the national enquirer which does have credibility and they're not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong ok a lot of money and there was a picture and that's the only thing i know so now they use the two things as the reason he won't support let me tell you something we if for no other reason if people really just like me and i don't think they do any more after the four days hey look if i have kids that like me that much how bad can i be right right and they love their daddy i was a good father but i'm smart children and good children and i'm getting a lot of credit i think they were the start of the convention mike i think they saved i think they saved us mike but not my children were really i mean and they're saying people are saying that they were the star the real stars of the convention everyone knew they would i was so proud of i mean it was such a great thing but to finish this was an amazing period of time this was an amazing invention i just heard a numbers dance cuz you know they're come up down for a second i just dance can be no feud you might have seen him and twitter and facebook you know what he is he's a facebook twitter junkie this guy that was the first time i've seen him look up in seven months he's always looking down but nobody knows facebook and twitter and that stuff better than then why don't you give just a quick report because i hear the numbers are astronomical ladies them you know we're dealing in a modern age i hate to do this a lot of people saying what facebook what's unfortunately we're dealing in a modern age how about giving a quick you want to hear this way did you hear the numbers you won't even believe go ahead thank you president trump visit mrs. i got it i have to tell you hashtag trump train is everybody out there the trump train is all here right this is surreal for everybody that's part of the campaign twitter last night exploded facebook exploded instagram exploded did everybody see the videos on mr. trump's twitter account instagram account facebook account i mean tens of millions of views we had over 85 million views on just those videos in about a 45 day period all right overhead almost half a million new followers on facebook mr. trump hit 10 million followers on twitter this this will never be done again it's impossible to be done again with this man right here it's absolutely impossible with his platforms a total of twenty two and a half million followers between instagram twitter and facebook 22 and a half million i don't know how you do this every day i this is insane impressions on twitter per month over 1 billion impressions on twitter and similar the numbers are going to come out for facebook they're gonna be probably in the billions it's absolutely unheard of so when mr. trump wants to get a message that we get those videos out and things are necessarily working out with cnn or somebody we can put it on his platform and get more views just on one of those social media accounts that mr. trump has which is at real donald trump on twitter donald j trump on facebook real donald trump on instagram and our next vice president of the united states is at mike under store pence ok so please follow him as well he has a governor account but he's still the governor of indiana so let's just try and follow them they're all right give him some engagements we're going to be pushing out a lot of messages for the campaign there's a lot of people behind me it's not only me brad part scale just akane this is a whole team so while we love you this is absolutely awesome to come out and talk to the hashtag trump train let's make america great again thank you so one of my really good choices in life although i'll confirm that in about three and a half months from now but i believe truly it will be one of my really great decisions is picking mike bends to run along with me to run for you and so i'd like to ask governor pets from the great state of indiana and we love indiana and bobby knight who i love and lou holtz and your wonderful you know gene from purdue we at mall and digger we got a lot of coaches out there but these guys are great people and they love mike and maybe mike can say a few words thank you we are so humbled and so grateful grateful to all of you the volunteers the people wearing the blue shirts the people that brought about the most exciting political convention of my entire lifetime thank you for your extraordinary work your tireless hours to all of those that did the work that did the setup that are doing the teardown now thank you so much thank you so much for creating a place where we could celebrate the kind of leadership that america is embracing more and more every hour as we move toward the november election but i just i just wanted to express a word of appreciation to all of you all of you who came here all of you who came alongside this good man and his family i from early on in this campaign where we're so excited to be a part of this team my wonderful wife karen pence is with us today and we are hitting the campaign trail together and i can just tell you i can just tell you having spent time with this man and his family having seen his ability to connect and speak for the american people i say with absolute confidence if we work with all of our hearts for every day between now and election day we will make donald trump the 45th president of the united states of america and we will make them there like a great again thank you and god bless you and let's go get it done yeah yeah thank you just one thing i want to leave you with supreme court justice no matter how much you like or dislike no matter what your feelings whether you're the governor of ohio whether you're a senator from texas or any of the other people that i beat so easily and so bad you have no choice you got to go for trump supreme court justices if hillary clinton gets it she is going to replace and last night i called him our beloved justice scalia he was going and we're gonna get somebody as close to him in his views and philosophy as possible conservative all the things you want the things we stand for as a part and i promise you and that's why i issued 11 names because being an outsider they said all we don't know supposing you put a liberal judges and say i have an idea never been done before you know we have a lot of ideas that people don't normally have right i said i have an idea in order to secure really have a problem they didn't know if they believe me well we don't know what happens if we elect him and then he puts up a liberal judges by the way are conservative republican presidents haven't done so well with the judges have them ok i mean we have obamacare should have been knocked out twice because of an appointment so you will do better will do much better that's why i put out a list of 11 judges but no matter what you think of donald trump as a republican if that's what your philosophy is if you're a great great believer in the constitution you have no choice hate to say it whether you're a hater your lover and by the way last night i don't think there was one hater in that room and that was a that was a back there were no seats in those seats were selling for a lot of money on ebay they were going for a big numbers in fact i was thinking about taking about 10 or 12 tickets and saying let's go but they were selling for a lot of money and and it was an amazing so just remember supreme court justice now i just want to finish by this we've had some incredible support because when i started everyone said you know some of these spawned its that now say oh well you can't do that you can these are the same people that say well if you runs but he won't run i ran and they said oh then they go but he won't win then i started off at six percent which is pretty high kirs i was only there for about two days people forgot so that was only two days i didn't get the full bath then it went to like 12 then went to 18 and every week is it well that's just sealing and you can't do more than that so there we go from six right these i saw them in the audience's - so we go from six to twelve to eighteen and every week ago well that's the ceiling charles krauthammer they will not run he will not run and if he runs he will just be doing it for fun this is not fun is a lot of work and there's a lot of work folks i didn't need this wasn't exactly the schedule but i saw how badly our country is doing and how easy it will be to bring back trade deals alone will make an impact like you won't believe money will come in jobs will come in and then you look at the military were so depleted but we're taking care of other nations and i want to continue to take care of other nations there are a lot of good things about that but they have to pay us they have to pay when i remember years ago and i've always said wow i never quite understood because he said the united states spends ten times the money on its military than anybody else in the world i said china's a big military all these but that it's surprising but i met you know i was building building some things i never would give it too much thought and then i realized and i remember i always remember we spent so much more than anybody else i said how can a beep we're protecting everybody in the world i mean we're protecting all these nations and these origination and they're great nations japan they send their cars they make a fortune and then they don't pay us the amount of course i want to make a profit that one cost pay is what it costs maybe we can't get it and we can't see you have to be prepared to walk after if you're not prepared to walk hillary clinton came out what you heard about what i said about japan japan is a very rich nation those cars are flowing in the rich because of us if you think about it okay those cars you got us engines you see these massive ships it looks like nascar by the way thank you brian france owner of nascar endorse donald from i love nascar richard petty endorse me all a lot of the great drivers endorsement king richard but they it's like it's like these guys driving like richard petty driving that they coming out of the boats these massive ships and they don't pay us and then a general gets up and the general says mr. trump is wrong doesn't he understand that japan days as fifty percent of the cost of defending them oh great shape mr. trump could we have a comment and say yeah why don't they have been a hundred percent but and germany and south korea we have 28 thousand soldiers and think of this one saudi arabia saudi arabia wouldn't be there for one week if we pulled out they have nothing but money nothing but money they have so much money than it didn't know what to do with it ok they don't know what to do with it who's making a deal service 1d like that has a massive impact on our budgets on our our economics as a country wept in nineteen trillion were very soon going to be 21 trillion dollars trillion nobody even knows what if i could take i could take the great harold him i could say tell me what a trillion dollars is although he's worth almost a trillion so he may know he may know but but you know honestly most people don't even know what the hell it so much they don't even know they would know how to define so here's a story we are going to do something really special in our message code on when i started this we had all these pundits sake what happen and a little staff corey lewandowski was great and you have to tell you and he's been very loyal and he's been on cnn and he's really been fighting for me which is very nice and i really i respect that a lot of hope hicks was hope up coming home coming home get up here home hope mix the legendary hoping come on up here how come come come she's shy get her up here come on home come on hope we had a very small but tough team we had a small is ho pics then i get a lift you over there barricade probably look at her she's very shy she's actually she's a very shy person but she's a great person she's done an amazing job and we had a staff of between george was our george come on over here come on tell us get over just stand over here someplace get up get up in the day has come on i get help but you can't get through the secret service people there and what happened so we had a small staff and i got criticized for did say so it's so i won't use this because i don't want to embarrass it so and so has said many times what trump is spent and has a much bigger safe and then we win i don't get any credit supposed to get credit if you have smaller staff less peril and you want but in politics you don't get credit so anyway so i want to thank my entire group then we beefed it up because we're really now in the final stretch three and a half months and all men afford has done an amazing job is here someplace where is paul ball man afford ok you made it all man afford has done a fantastic and all appalls people vol brod on staff and we really do we have a great staff of talented people a great staff and their most of the right here and john and everybody my man right here and my call enough to be michael come on up michael get up here michael come on get a little tv time look at him i don't know if he's going to be hired for hollywood i tend to doubt it but you never come on up rick so we have a great group of people and we have a group of people that really wants to win and i think knows how to win and we've also have been winning all our lives this group of people in front of me i know so many of you we've been winning all our lives we've got exactly three months and three weeks i am going to be working so hard i'm not going to like last time where they disappeared for the last month and a half what happened where is everybody what happened and give obama credit he was on every television show he was all over the place we're not going to disappear so we have a really great chance of taking our country back of change and of getting great supreme court justices so i want to thank everybody i love you folks this has been such an incredible movement i love you i know so many of you we're going to go all the way and i'll tell you what when we get there we will indeed make america great again they turned away that thank you very much they turned away thousands of people look at the size of this place they turned away thousand they were given orders that no more than a thousand people now hillary clinton i have a picture here which is pretty said she had she had last week or a couple of days ago look at all totally empty but is the marriage democrat is the democrat of the what i heard you had to be ashamed of himself they turned away thousands of people but that makes it better for you right not it's very sad you know shouldn't be so much about politics folks well we're going to account also we're gonna be talking about questions and this and that i'll say a few words but outside i met two gentlemen from piketon who really were misrepresented very badly very badly by president obama and they're gonna come up come on up fellas i just met him come on because we're gonna bring back our jobs we're not going to let our jobs go to mexico and all these other countries we're gonna renegotiate the horrible nafta deal which is maybe the worst deal ever made from an economic development standpoint and i'm not just talking in this country i'm talking about in the world we're going to bring back our jobs and we're also we're also going to stop radical islamic terrorism we're not letting the people come in we're not letting him come in and they can play all the games they want but we're not you know hillary clinton wants a five hundred and fifty percent increase from syria coming into this country over obama and you'd actually say what is she doing so here's a letter from president obama to these two gentlemen that have worked so hard and are having a hard time and maybe in just a little while you could just say exactly what's going on my name is jeff fall break i'm from portsmouth ohio we have a plant just north of portsmouth in piketon that enriched uranium and for seven years evan and i have been going to washington and talking to politicians about saving the plant that enriched uranium there were hundreds of jobs there and it's the only it was the only plant in the united states that enriched uranium but i also have the hotel the holiday inn in portsmouth and then senator barack obama who was running for president came and stayed at my hotel and he said i'm going to get up at five o'clock in the morning and i need breakfast but you're not open yet sighs all right two things you have to promise me something and you have to get your picture taken with me so i fixed him six eggs six strips of bacon a big pile of home-fried potatoes for whole wheat toast and a big bowl of oatmeal and i asked him how do you eat all it only male get today so he had his picture taken with me lift up to that promise then i said we have this plant in piketon that we want to continue enriching uranium lots of employees we need the government help and we also need the old site cleaned up how do you feel about that project in piketon and the man looked me in the eye he says i support the pipe then project so i want to thank donald trump he's here in ohio and and i i don't know him personally but i feel like he's the man that if he says i'm gonna do something i'm gonna do it so let's all support donald trump kevin go ahead the only thing i've got to know one thing i've got to say is when his politician make promises which has been promised to us that somebody hold them accountable yeah thank you both very much same old stuff politicians all talk no action won't happen and you know hilary will be nothing more than four more years of obama four more years of isis four more years of a military that's being depleted and not taking care of our vets she said a few months ago our vets are being taken care of just fine she said no no it's over exaggerated i know the vents i think i have tremendous support with events raised a lot of money and gave a lot of money to the vets i will tell you something the vets are not being taken care of well at all the suicide rate is hard to believe even when you hear the numbers and you know the numbers i'm talking about they wait in line for two three four five days thinking of going to a doctor and waiting for five days longer than that and people are dying waiting in line so we're going to take care of our vets we're going to again secure and very important we're going to secure our borders i'm going to secure our borders yeah yeah playing ability we're going to build the wall and mexico's gonna pay for the wall and the reason some of the politicians have said you know they're not going to pass it no no you don't understand they gonna pay they are making so much money mexico they're taking our business a friend of mine bills plants that's what he does plants if you had a building apartment you wouldn't know where to begin but he builds massive plants among the biggest in the world and i said to him recently how are you doing he said unbelievable now he's from this country and they'd like to do well in this country but i said how are you doing he said unbelievable i said that's good so you doing a lot of work in the united states not so much said well how are you doing unbelievably you wouldn't believe what's happening in mexico it's the eighth wonder in the world that's what he told me and so what does that mean he said they're building among the biggest plants we've ever built it's unbelievable companies are moving out of the united states columbus by the way they're moving out of the united states they're moving out of ohio i asked them they're moving out of michigan big-league the cars he bills car plans he bills computer plans for small and they're moving out of the united states i said well how the united states doing this is not so good he said but mexico is the eighth wonder of the world that's going to end folks we want mexico to do fine but we're not going to let him take our jobs anymore we're not going to let it happen you look at this area i mean i have statisticians right good statisticians they love to do this i can't imagine doing it being too much fun to me it would be a little bit boring to do but i'll tell you the numbers are horrendous first of all i don't know if you just saw the number for growth of our country do you see that growth one-point-two percent one-point-two percent we're sinking we're sinking that's one of the lowest numbers ever i think it's the lowest number ever in terms of trying to make a comeback one-point-two percent but in columbus and i looked at this and this is bad this is bad ohio is lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton side nafta bill clinton signed it and hillary clinton wants think of that hillary clinton's disastrous trade policies are responsible for the manufacturing job losses in ohio and throughout the other states yeah yeah i've got a machine and i'll tell you the problem with the machine it totally controls the press you look at cnn it's called the clinton news network gold a long drop drop all day long cnn throb throb throb such a bad guy i just want to bring back your jobs i want to bring back his safety because we're not safe five hundred and fifty percent more people coming in from syria and other territories and we have no idea who they are and i've got to the best law enforcement officials and they said there's no way of you telling and they have all sorts of false things you know they stole our passport machine you saw that they make passports better than we do ok they have think of it five hundred and fifty percent more than obama and he's letting in thousands and thousands of people the people in ohio the people in the rust belt and they called the rust belt for a reason because everything is rusting and writing you lost your jobs they're moving to mexico remember my friend with the plan when you get a vote remember this november eight when you go to vote remember my friend with the plant where he says it's the eighth wonder of the world and we're gonna read a goat if you want unless you don't want to do this we're going to renegotiate nafta and it was very it was very funny the other day i saw hillary clinton saying first time ever we are going to start renegotiating our trade deals that's been me for years that's been me number one she won't do a good job of it for a lot of reasons but one of them is that she's totally controlled by the special interests and you know like i'll give you an example i just saw this number just read it coming up here donald trump has raised nineteen thousand dollars from hedge funds now i don't know how it got into i don't even want it to go send it back hillary clinton from hedge funds has raised 48.5 million pickle 48.5 million dollars i hope you don't i have a friend who's very wealthy he doesn't on his front cover but ray's 48.5 million i have 19,000 i think i'll send the 19,000 back probably a nice person but think of it but here is really what's important to me so i find it as you know my primary people are very happy i'm continuing to fund my general election but we're also taking small donations which is the primary wasn't a big factor because we didn't really we sold hats and things little things that was cute and people like it and people put in small money but i funded it and i guess i'm into everything for 60 million or over 60 million or soon will be over 60 million but i'm continuing to fund my campaign but we're also raising money from people when they send in a check small donors right you've sent to check who sent it to check wow whoa that's fantastic so we only started last month and she's gonna have like a fortune she's gonna have like a billion billion and a half because she's gonna be totally controlled like we talked about uranium the two gentlemen great people well he had a lot to do with russian uranium you saw that deal and jack's got paid a fortune for allowing russia to come in talk about uranium that's big self ok got paid a fortune and we'll be talking about that during the campaign don't worry about it but so we started really around the middle of june and we had a tremendous year and there was a donald trump didn't raise any what it we didn't start we started in the middle of gym and we raised i think was 27 million dollars from the small donor that was around 60 some odd dollars apiece and we also raise from other people about i don't know the total was about 51 million dollars okay that was until we hardly that was like for half a month because people want to see something happen with our country but here's what's really good this is just going to be reported i think today or tomorrow we have raised with the small donor 35.8 million dollars i believe it's five hundred and seventeen thousand donors think of that that's in a month so we raise 35.8 million even a little more than that and the average price of the donation with $69 how incredible is that right and it's not even to me the money it's to me the concept in all fairness bernie sanders was doing that you know because there was a movement that was a movement on the other side of the plate but you know what he had one thing in common with me he knew that the trade deals are destroying our country the difference is he couldn't do anything about the trade deals i'll take those trade deals to make them so good that's what i do i love taking bad deals are making them good that's what i do i take bad deals and make them good naft is a bad bad bad deal and i'm going to make it good but think of that so we raised 35.8 million in excess of that in a month and then in addition we raised money that has been tabulated yet from people that are putting up larger numbers but that's going to the republican national largely to the republican national committee and i'm and i'm putting up money to run my campaign ok so when you see when you see that clinton crooked hillary crooked she's crooked as a three-dollar bill let me tell you she is critical when you see crooked hillary with 40 8.5 million from hedge funds and drop at nineteen thousand dollars when they call me because they want to stop a company from doing something or when they call me because they want one of your companies to get the green light to move into mexico and fire everybody believe me i'm going to take care of these come i'm gonna do what's right for you she's got to do right for her donors i'm gonna do right for you so it's going to be a big difference going to do it going to be a pic so so i just tell you were battling a lot of things but we're battling the press because the press is very dishonest ok press is very discerning so so as an example as an example i gave a very good answer over the weekend to one of the shows on russia going into the ukraine i said very simply they're not gonna do it on my watch essentially i said russia will not go into the equation now i said that and the next day the story comes out and we really let it roll it but actually i think it was usa today a couple of them covered it accurately what i said but a couple of papers said donald trump doesn't realize that the crimea was already taken i know an exact two years ago approximately ok approximately it was taken during obama's watch so when i said i believe me russia's not going into ukraine all right they're not going into ukraine the person said but they're already in ukraine i said yeah well that was two years ago thats that's i mean you want to go back you wanna have world war three to get it back that was during obama's watch so during obama's watch it all the tough-guy statements right so he talks about donald trump is not strong russian first of all i have to say this would it be great if we actually got along with russia am i wrong and saying be great ok you know russia like us has nuclear weapons folks it would be really nice if we got along with russia and others that we don't get along with right now and wouldn't it be nice if we teamed up with russia and others including surrounding states and maybe nato and we knocked the hell out of isis and got rid of these before but but but even beyond that even beyond putin said some very good things about me people say all trump's gonna be week with putin because putin is saying nice things about me okay all right and i said he's a strong guy they immediately say all trump likes but look i don't like what just like i just say this way wouldn't it be great if the united states and russia got along combined knocked out isis maybe did other positive things you know we forced them through stupidity into an alliance with china you know why because of oil because china needs oil we were driving both crazy they formed and from the time i was a young guy i've always learned don't ever let china and russia get together we force them together obama force them together because he didn't get along with either and they eventually china came in and said let's make it the illinois oil it together fact they're doing naval exercises together someplace and you look at china they're building one of the largest military installations in the world writes back in the middle of the south china sea and then they talk about donald trump and russia or donald trump but believe me folks somebody can say nice things about me he did call me a genius but these are minority somebody can say nice things about me has it makes no difference it makes no difference right i've been dealing a long time a lot of times i make much better deals with people that say terrible things about me i don't care what they say about me i want the deal you know what trade one of the people that standing back there one of the dishonest media well what's your definition of trade i said well you're fair trade you've also what you have so many different types of trade but here's my definition of trade because right now we're being ripped off 500 billion dollar trade deficit with china 500 billion and they give us product we let him in no tax no nothing you want to try and make a deal with china you can get your product in and if you do you pay tax and if you do you also have to build plants over there and they don't even want that they don't want you in there one-sided deal so when they said what's your trade deal i said very simply i want to make great deals to the united states we don't have to name it you have a fair trade you have all sorts of names i learned every single one of them in college now we've added a couple is the problem we have stupid people doing are negotiating we have stupid people doing our negotiation i'll give you an example if a company in ohio said they're gonna leave we're gonna fire which as you know many companies are leaving and by the way as you're sitting here right now right now we have companies negotiating with mexico and other places too close up in ohio and to move into mexico or other places ok as you're sitting here right now some of you people think you have good jobs guess what carrier thought they had good jobs for thought they had good you have lots of hundreds and hundreds thousands of companies have left thousands millions of jobs and hillary clinton is weak and she's ineffective and there's no way you can allow for more years of this stuff to go on there's just no way in my opinion but let's say oh by the way your steel mills in ohio where china's dumping steel to put you guys out of business they're dumping you know that is it still love you am i right they're dumping steel to put the steel workers at a business and hillary said the miners any minors in here - i love the miners all west virginia was good to me i'll tell you and ohio is good to me a lot of minors in ohio minor but hillary clinton said we're gonna put the miners in the mindset of business now she said that before probably an environmental group or something but then she tried to back up but they remembered she said it and she got clobbered in west virginia smart people she got clobbered in west virginia ok so so we're gonna have clean call and we're gonna have steel and we're gonna make up products a kid and we're gonna have the people in columbus and all of ohio and all of michigan and all of these other states and i did great in michigan i did great in ohio - unfortunately i didn't have a long time to campaign i would spend two more days here i would have won ohio - because i want practically everything else we got we got almost 14 million votes think of that more than anybody in the history of republican primers that includes some great people like ronald reagan dwight d eisenhower who won the second world war right it did when the second world walk got elected because he won the second world war i got more votes in him that's good right and remember this i had 17 people i didn't i was running against two people and 17 people hillary clinton i got a similar number to hillary clinton and she had birdie and she had a hard time putting bernie away and bernie bernie he looked so upset he you know what he made a mistake he shouldn't have made a deal sometimes he lost he lost first was wrecked and i'm afraid the election is going to be rick i have to be honest because i think my site was rigged if i didn't win by massive landslides i mean think of what we want in new york and indiana california seventy-eight percent that's with other people ended in the race but think of it i hear more and more that the election or not november eighth can you believe we're almost there this started on june sixteenth of last year and i said wow let's go do it takes guts to do this believe me and everybody said now it takes guts i could be having a very nice life right now i don't have to be with you people ranting and raving right could have a very nice like but it takes guts and everybody said this is the greatest field i remember charles krauthammer sing this is the greatest field ever assembled in the history of republican politics or something to that effect this is before i got in and i said to my wife you know it's a great field charles krauthammer and others are saying this is the greatest field ever assembled it's also the largest field ever assembled so i have the greatest largest field ever assemble and then one day i just i had it i watch the iran deal this horrible deal be done when we get back a hundred and fifty billion dollars and they're making nuclear weapons and we've made a power out of her and they were struggling for their life and we've made a power out of around fact they were in serious trouble when they were all marching in the streets it was over and obama came to their rescue if you remember that first term that was a bad day that was going to be over for them and we came to their rescue now we've made him into a power ok a big power but i saw the iran deal and i saw the stupidity on trade where companies are leaving one of them was carrier left indiana 1,400 people fired moving to indiana going to make their plant they're gonna build it they're gonna take their air conditioners make them sell them right back into indiana in other places no tax no nothing with me they're going to be taxed 35% and you know what they're never gonna move that never moving fault then never moving okay then never moving did you ever see because i love this love you know i've been look you know people say not a politician remember when they said a certain person well he got clobbered raise tremendous amounts of money and everybody thought he did really well but they say but he hasn't been an active politician for eight years i've never been a politician and we wanted a landslide so but i don't get credit for that they don't give me credit what are you gonna get you know i was joking i was joking because some people thought it was a little bit too tough and i have been certain people that i ran against and the republican primaries have never come back and they probably won't and that's okay i do better when they don't come back i do better if i have him as my opponent is a as opposed to my ally no no but we have a few you know the names we have a few they haven't come back they haven't come back and say i was honored at the convention for two reasons number one i had 35 million people watching hillary had 128 million people this final speech so we had more people watching depressed built up that convention like it was the greatest a democrat can i actually thought i like the republican convention i would rather watch i would rather watch ivanka trump yeah than any of their celebrities i can tell you i would rather watch don and eric and tiffany and milania did a great job i would rather watch them than any of their celebrities you know they all said well donald trump and his kids with that nice if you have kids and a capable enough to go up and do you know why people haven't had their kids go up because they kids can't do it and i can understand that that's a hard thing to do my kids went up there were brave they were strong tiffany we push her out on the stage go and she never did it be tiffany said this is really scary and we just had just go do it she did beautifully she never spoke to anybody throw the biggest groups has ever spoken to was like 18 people in its last where she was a very good student i have to say but but you know they did a great job but i actually like the republican national convention better i'll tell you what we had a much better looking stage number one which is a book we want fish but we got a very unfair pressed when bernie sanders had his people leaving the room nobody covered that if i would have had people leave the room would have been a national scandal when a certain man got up that and i knew a speech i said let him speak what difference does it make and it says certain man got up and he spoke and everybody in the room boo the hell out of them fact i saved his life when i walked back into the room but everybody on their own and his numbers went down like from 68 to 20 something that's called unity folks that's unity that's a good thing not a bad thing that is unity and but the problem we have the biggest problem we have i think is the press the new york times is totally dishonest totally dishonest the washington post got a little bit better lately i took away their press credentials i should do it with the touch but the problem is you get more publicity from doing just let him rot but the new york times is really really dishonest and it's failing i don't think they'll be in business more than two or three years look at their numbers their failing but they do a number that's unbelievable every story's been in fact sometimes they'll say oh great this was so good i'm gonna have a great story tomorrow in the new york times you know they'll call always turned out to be a disaster they it's so dishonest and yet hilary hilary crooked hillary they write beautifully about right washington post similar it was really bad now it's gotten a little bit better i must tell you so watch your post got a little bit better cnn is so dishonest clinton news network so dishonest unbelievable you know what they call it it may be the clinton news network but nobody wants to watch hillary all day long it's trump all day all the time that's one but it's so it's so much inaccurate information and by the way i think their ratings are going to go down really sharply now they've been asking me to go on for months i won't do this shows and the reason i won't is because it's so dishonest that until they straight up i'm not doing their shows and when people finally realized that i'm not doing their jobs they stopped watching that's what happened and i must say i don't say this for a reason and they're tough they're very tough on me but fox has at least been fair they've been fair fox has been training so at some point at some point we're just going to keep barreling through people asked me to run people ask me later on at real donald trump and letters and everything you know we have twenty two and a half million people between twitter and can you believe it you know i have a lot of people they say don't use twitter anymore why i got 22 million people between that and facebook and instagram and i'm a very modern person in a way right but thank you it you know who says don't use twitter your enemies or people why wouldn't i use it why would if i have all these millions of people and it's a great way to get a message out so when they write falsely or say something totally false on the today show good morning america i put out a tweet and you see all over television we have breaking news and i may be tweeting from bed ok a little stroke it's instantaneous if i put out a beautiful long perfectly scripted press release like i did yesterday nobody puts it out if i put out like a 140-character tweet they go crazy we have breaking news they break into every story so so you gotta use again why is the story so i'm going i love ohio i've been here working out of you know i worked in cincinnati for a period of time i had great success was one of my first jobs i did it with my father was called swift and village and we bought something that was a disaster it was empty and had 11 hundred and fifty four units it was a total disaster and we bought it from hud and turned it around i was here i did a great job gave me great confidence because it's good to hit with a good job and then we sold it at a at a great for tremendous profit and we went on to the next and i loved cincinnati and interestingly after i sold it the job went very bad the job was very bad i mean it when my timing was very good and i listened to people but i really listen to myself and the timing was beautiful we had it for a number of years but we sold it fact from the day i sold it to the day we close contract was bought by a reek one of the early roots it lost a lot of its occupants that's how the timing was like perfect timing and i just think of since i the queen city i love cincinnati i love kentucky i did not go to kentucky for fun i won't tell you what can you imagine that story if they find out about that but i love kentucky and kentucky likes me but it i do well in kentucky kentucky we love kentucky and we're going to take care of the miners in kentucky believe me we're going to take care of the miners in kentucky but i had a great time in cincinnati and i had a great time in ohio the people of ohio or special people and they're smart people and they know when it's happening to him they know great things are going to happen we are going to turn this state into a manufacturing behemoth we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to bring your company's back we're gonna bring companies that left are going to come back because it will no longer be economic for them to continue where they are we're going to bring companies back we're going to bring companies back you know i tell this one story that you heard about with carrier in indiana which i wanted a landslide that was supposed to be the firewall remember indiana will be his firewall they said new york we expect them to win pennsylvania we expect them to win one maryland rhode island delaware we want to go we expected him but indiana is going to be the firewall right and then bobby knight called and bobby knight how bout bobby knight i will of bobby now winner he's a winner bobby knight and he came out you know nine hundred games three national championships last undefeated college team won the olympics one the pan am games other than that thanks coach right we love bobby knight and what a job and what a tough cookie and he said to me i hope you're gonna run for president this before i know what we call me you should run for president you'll be great i said bobby i haven't decided this was before june sixteenth few months i haven't decided so just run and then when i ran and i called him and he said i've been waiting for you to call and we went to indiana and it was incredible but the thing that happened that i've been talking about for a year and it happened to be in indiana was when carrier air conditioner fired a hundred and 1,400 people right they fired 1,400 people like like dogs like dogs may fire it's on tape had i not seated on tape on television it would have had the impact that it had these are people that have worked there some of them for more than 30 years and they would follow me around all over indiana i don't have the people from care so let me just tell you if i were negotiating and let's say i heard they were going to clubs and if i said folks want to meet with you where's your president they said the president said let me tell you you're leaving 1400 great people now if you want to stay within the united states that's a different deal the states will compete against themselves right but you want to move to mexico you want to build a plant i wish you luck but if you do that you're going to pay this thirty-five percent tax here's what's going to happen fuck well here's what's gonna happen so simple they're not gonna leave they're not gonna leave because it doesn't work economically for them to leave so now they're not going to leave and if they do leave that's okay too because we're going to make a fortune okay we're gonna make a fortune now i've been watching this country for seven or eight or nine years even before obama working on plans to stop people and companies from leaving the united states i've seen low-interest loans i've seen zero interest i've seen it all i've seen it all i seen every plan you can imagine i've seen where they give them money they substance they do everything a lot of these companies don't need money they just want to make more but you know what my plan which is so simple we don't need anything nice and simple and when i say that to the company if you're running a company you in the blue and you're running a company and i say to you if you leave ohio i wish you a lot of luck enjoy the warm climate in mexico but if you leave ohio you're not gonna make your product and sell it back into ohio where you have all these unemployed people what's gonna happen is you're going to have a tax to pay to get the product back in and when you hear that you're not going to be very fast so if you're not going to actually leave ok almost a hundred percent you're not gonna believe it's just not gonna work because the economics don't work anymore and when my friend talks about it's the eighth wonder of the world mexico i think that's great i respect mexico i love the mexican people have thousands of mexican people that have worked for me over the years thousands and thousands are great but their leaders are too smart for our leaders ok and they're stripping our country and they're stripping ohio so hillary clinton doesn't talk this way hilary gets up and she reads her teleprompter we are going to build new roads we are going to build new schools we are going to go we're going to build and just like the two gentlemen that came up here you'll be let down a hundred percent but me this is my thing i've been talking about this for years you know somebody said you know it's amazing constant talking about this for 20 years it used to be japan number one i talked about japan now it's china but it's still japan japan made a fortune devaluing their currency china makes a fortune with currency manipulation it's cheating it's cheating and when i sit down and say listen you got to stop this you're killing us you got 500 billion dollar trade deficits for us you got to stop it we have rebuilt china and when i tell him this and when i said listen you gotta do it you gotta do it see we have all the power but nobody knows and when we catch him cheating ten percent tax rate across the board every good coming in from china right now here's what's gonna happen number one they're going to stop cheating and if they don't we collect ten percent we make a fortune but they're gonna stop cheating there's nobody that tells them this when they come over president obama they acquitted tent on the white house lawn right and they give mistake dinner like you've never seen before i would have a ballroom i offered to build a ballroom you know that sir they turned it down i was gonna i was going to put up a hundred million dollars to build a ballroom at the white house because having a tent is not that good it's not even that safe canvas tent and they never even got back to me that's the way it is if i were president somebody offered that i'd say give me the top five american architects in the united states get him over here all of you come up with the ball room that holds a thousand people 1,000 people and they'll come up but one of them will be beautiful and we'll build it i'll take the guys money believe me i promise somebody wants to build a ballroom at the white house they turned me down no interest no interest because that's the way the country roads so i'm always saying to the people of ohio to the people of columbus i want to tell you we're gonna turn this country around and we're going to make it so strong and so great and we're gonna run it smart we're not going to run its stupid like it is you're not going to have when i look at your numbers when when my statistician rights all this stuff out it's just one bed number after another it's it's a terrible i mean honestly it's a terrible thing look columbus columbus ohio is lost one and three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed after right columbus has lost one in for manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed an agreement to put china into the world trade organization right hilary ram through the job-killing trade deal with south korea that's for the killer the deal with south korea's been a killer i by thousands of television sets thousands and thousands nobody makes television since remember we used to have sylvania for those of us that are old enough we had general electric we had all these companies we got nobody we don't make television sets will make any we don't make a lot soon we won't make anything soon and you can only have so many nursing homes in a factory you know a lot of factories were taken they were made into nursing homes i think that's great but you can only have so many that we need jobs whitney jobs what it is i've been abandoned the diplomatic personnel it is so many different things supports i told you this support to five hundred and fifty percent increase was sort of amazing because the president said well you're wrong and you exaggerated that number no matter if you said to into a for they will get these super liberal groups to say well he's not really right it's not really for you know when i read off the crime statistics about the police that are being shot like in dallas and other places and i read about it and i said we had a fifty percent increase in police shooting and they say well yeah but that was only for this year but if you go over 10 years or 12 years or if you go over seven point three years there's a little bit less look folks the country is a mess we're gonna make it strong again we're going to make it safe again you're going to be so proud of you gonna be so proud of him and you're going to be proud of your president but more importantly going to be proud of your country okay so why don't we take a few questions and when we're finished with the questions let's go back to work and those of you that don't have work hang in there jobs will be back sooner than you think ok believe yeah go ahead hello hi my name is the white flag for mana hai and four years we've been told by the obamacare supporters that the laws working because it has increased healthcare coverage for everybody and also that the health care spending growth has you know gone down right but it's not true because the sea you know the cbo and then and right cms has told us the truth my question for you is what are you going to do to repeal obama okay great what's your plan they can't be a better question other than our defense okay because we're going to build up are depleted military most important defense is always number one don't you think but we're gonna build up later we're gonna take care of our vets ok obamacare number one we're going to repeal it and replace it 100% it is a total disaster you so what's happening in texas blue cross blue shield working through obamacare sixty percent increase here's the thing you want nobody noses the numbers are so bad on obamacare so bad that our november first they're going to be announced those numbers are presidential election changing numbers those numbers are going to be so high beyond anything we've had and president obama is trying to change the date to december first because when people see what's going to happen to obamacare and to your healthcare numbers is so astronomical that people will never vote for crooked hillary clinton never gonna vote for so and and and you asked a very interesting question the way you phrased it was very interesting because you have a lot of part-time workers now that never had a part-time job in their life you have people in this room don't raise your heads but you have people in this room that are making less money now then they made 18 years ago in real wages less money and in some cases they're making less money and working two jobs and that's largely because of obamacare because companies save money by breaking it up so they'll take full time beautiful employees that have worked for companies for years and those am sorry you're going to be a part-time employee from note obamacare has been a disaster obamacare is so unfair and you know you had a lot of people that had good plans and we have to take care of people that cant that don't have the money to take care of themselves you look like a rich guy okay least modestly rich i think could be very rich but we have to take care of people that can afford and i'm all for that and we have something coming i think that's going to be great and a lot of republicans would say that's not republican let me tell you it is republican folks you know every time i've ever said it i've never had anybody other than the egg kids you know the people that said trump is never gonna run and he runs i don't think he'll do very well we go to six we got to 12 12 24 we got to think i may forget it but you know what other than the so-called eggheads we never and i mean this i've never had anybody in the audience when i said we're gonna have a great plan we're getting rid of the boundaries we're gonna have great private competition and you're gonna have plans now that we can't even talk about because these companies will come up with plans and it's gonna be so much less expensive and so much better and for the people that can't afford that we're going to take care of them and i tell you what i've never had one person and i have the biggest crowds of anybody i've never had one person stand up and say that's not republican except for the eggheads they say you can't do that we got to take care of people we can't have people dying in the streets we can have our vets as an example dying waiting on line because they can't get to see a doctor and without that interestingly but with our vets when you have these massive weights we're going to have our vets go to the local doctors or the local hospital private or public take care of themselves they're not going to be committed suicide many are committing suicide because of the weights they can't stand it they can't stand the pain simple procedures can save their life simple procedures a little incision a small operation a pill a pill can save their lives in there dying waiting for a doctor and we're gonna end my plan is filed policy we're gonna have people they can't get in they're gonna go they're gonna see a local doctor going to see a local hospital public or private we're going to pay for the bill and by the way that's number one from a humanitarian standpoint that's great and even even less importantly because ultimately we got to say people it's gonna be less expensive and we're not going to have the problems that we have where people are committing suicide so many people every day that's are committing suicide because they can't even get to see the doctor to help them it's one of the big reasons of that suicide so we're going to take care of that and we're gonna take care of the above we're going to repeal replace we're going to take care of everybody okay thank you good question ok yes go ahead i mr. trump is my name is ryan rivers my business owner president obama has made thousands of regulations that have heard small business as president what will you do to help small businesses well it's really a great question ryan because the thing that may be surprised me the most is to me taxes are very important to all taxes and to such a big cost or can be a big cost now we have a tax bill we have a tax law that is very complicated but it's a big cost if you would have told me going around and i've met so many small business owners and so many large business owners that if they had their choice between bringing our taxes down now i have the largest tax decrease of anybody that's run for office larry cudlow loves it a lot of people love it but it's the largest tax decrease of any person running for office from the beginning republican or democrat ok hilary is gonna have to double taxes gonna have to double your taxes hillary clinton will double your taxes we're bringing it down to fifteen percent we're simplifying the system people that are making very little going to pay nothing until they can break into the system and you'll save a lot of money bureaucratically that way but people that are making very little going to pay nothing instead of sending in complicated returns and paying nothing but we have a very beautiful plan very simple very simple and very important but if you would have told me after speaking with thousands of people that regulations if they had their choice you can have either reduce regulation because people can open businesses they can't run their businesses you can either have lower taxes or reduce regulation people would take the regulation that surprised me that's how bad regulations are you look at the energy the energy business is being put out of business speak put out of business many small business owners have come up to me saying mr. trump middle is my businesses are regulations so we're gonna we're gonna take care we're gonna cut down the regulations i would debt between 85 and 90 percent ok now some unnecessary you know for safety but some are necessary but i'll bet we can cut every year there must be a cottage industry there are people that just write regulations all day long we're going to cut down regulations between 85 and 90 percent we're going to take care of the environment we're going to take care of safety but we're gonna let it be that we're going to be a growing growing when you look at one point two percent that set a record that means we're drowning means we're drowning is where we're going in the opposite direction so we're going to take care of regulations we're gonna have a very very big cuts and regulations ok another question who's got the mic who's got go ahead yes aight that mr. trump hi my name is i don't renege on taurus i have 60 years old and i'm from for rica good i think you know erinite herring heroin yeah it's an everyday me here in a higher my question is will you please will you please cut off the source yeah i will cut off the source build the wall i will cut off this yep good question very well as thank you very much a heroine so my first victory as a candidate number one was new hampshire which is a beautiful beautiful place beautiful trees beautiful meadows beautiful little roads and i got to know the people of new hampshire very well and i did i'm believe we won in a landslide in new hampshire that was at the beginning we had all these people competing it's a great state and they have unbelievable people i get to know the people and they go into meetings i'd say so what's your biggest problem and they would always say heroin heroin i said what i mean heroin they say heroin i said this doesn't look like it's a heroine like problem type place they say mr. trump it is flowing across our southern border it's cheaper than candy our kids are being poisoned they're being addicted not only kids but kids they're being addicted they're dying and for some reason new hampshire more than any other place talks about that's why i'm so glad you asked that question but heroin so i said so where do you think it comes what's the source the source is the southern border comes from the southern border i said let me tell you if i went i'm going to stop it i'm going to stop it now we had 16,500 border patrol agents who are unbelievable people who if they didn't endorsement would have a much easier job because all they have to do is stand there people walk right through right with me they're gonna stop people from coming into our country ok they're gonna stop up and they're not gonna have to work that hard because the wall i asked him how important is the wall they said very important very important but so new hampshire told me about heroin and i said wow and i said if i win i'm gonna stop heroin from coming in to this country and they're going to be big repercussions and i'm going to get the government of mexico and other governments to stop it or they've got problems with all the money we give them they'd better take better care they're not taking care of us they're not taking care of us you know i talked about trade deficits we have a massive trade deficit with mexico that doesn't include the drugs that are coming across we get the drugs they get the money like this big vans coming across drugs coming in money going out those days are over folks those days are over so so so i i won new hampshire then went down to all different places we did great in massachusetts home of tom brady we love tom brady but we did great in massachusetts we did great sort of everywhere but i see what a huge problem it's not just in new hampshire it's all over the place heroin is all over the place mothers and fathers are losing their children and heroin is a very addictive thing it's very hard to get out of that addiction of heroin it's very very hard and that's the other thing we're going to do we're going to take all of these kids and people not just kids that are totally addicted and they can't break it we're going to work with him we're going to spend the money we're gonna get that happened broken but we're not going to let this crap come into our country and poison our youth and poison our people and it comes in mostly from the southern border and hillary clinton isn't gonna do that number one she's not strong enough to do it she wouldn't have a clue so ladies and gentlemen thank you very much people of new york when they give us this kind of a vote and its just incredible and i guess we're close to 70% and we're going to end a very high level and get a lot more delegates than anybody projected even there were in their wildest imagination so i just want to thank everybody here i want to i really want to thank my team my team has been amazing and you know it's actually a team of unity it's evolving but people don't understand that the president's understand that they just don't want to talk about it thats ok just keep talking very important keep talking but this has been an incredible evening it's been an incredible day and week we went all over new york state new york state has problems like virtually every other state in the union our jobs are being sucked out of our states are being taken out of our country and we're not going to let it happen anymore we're going to stop it very importantly and i have to end behind me i have to say we have some of our great business man of the world carl icahn is here someplace with howard lorber been loved the great steve fraud is building a big building on central park south it's a tremendous success i said steve congratulations on the building he said donald it's nothing compared to what's happening with you is that right my men so anyway we're proud of what we have a great leaders and it has been really something it has been really something amazing and believe me we're going to use our great business people to negotiate unbelievable trade deals so we bring our jobs back and we don't let our companies going to mexico and all of these other countries anymore we're gonna keep the jobs here you gonna be very proud of this country very soon we're going to build our military bigger better stronger than ever before with us that i can tell you we're gonna take care of our beds we gonna our vets are are great people and we have forgotten our vets illegal immigrants are taken care of in many cases better than our vets that's not gonna happen anymore that is not going to happen we getting rid of obamacare it's going to be repealed and replaced it is a total disaster with premiums going up 35 45 55 percent it's going to probably end of his own volition we're getting rid of it will bring in common core will not get out we're cutting it it's going to be over and we'll bring in education locally local communities are gonna take care of their educational needs and people have been waiting for that for a long time so with all of the things that have happened today tonight and over the weekend i'll tell you what this has been an amazing week all over new york state dole needs and people have been waiting for that for a long time so with all of the things that have happened today tonight and over the weekend i'll tell you what this has been an amazing week all over new york state we went to syracuse we went to albany 20,000 people on average we have fifteen to twenty thousand people we went to rochester we went to best phage we went all over and you know what the people of this country and the people of this state truly are great and amazing people we are going to be so strong again we would be really i mean early so great again and i just can't wait so we don't have much of a race anymore based on what i'm seeing on television senator cruises just about mathematically eliminated and we've won and other state as you know we have won millions of more votes than senator crews millions and millions of more votes then governor jay sick leave london and now especially after tonight close to 300 delegates more than senator crews we're really really we expect we're going to have an amazing number of weeks because these are places and they're in trouble there in big trouble when you look at pennsylvania you when you look at indiana when you look at maryland and rhode island in so many places we have problems everywhere you looked we are going to solve those problems and one of the big problem one of the big problems is the economy and jobs and that is my wheelhouse so again i want to thank everybody it's really nice to win the delegates with the votes you know it's really nice impossible to catch us know that he should take delegates and claim victory unless they get those delegates with voters and voting and that's what's going to happen and you watch because the people are not going to stand for its a cricket system it's a system that ridge at wigan to go back to the old way it's called you vote and you win so we'll be going into the convention no matter what happens and i think we're going to go in so strong and over the next number of weeks we just saw poll come out of california which is an unbelievable poll but we're going to going to the convention i think as the winner but nobody can take an election away with the way they're doing it in the republican party and by the way i am no fan of bernie but i've seen verde win-win-win and that i watch and they say he has no chance of winning so they have this super delegate to republican system is worse so i wanna just thank everybody i have great great admiration and praise for the city of new york in the state of new york i can't think of nowhere that i would rather have this victory so we love you all have a great evening and we go back to work i'm flying tomorrow morning and fly tomorrow morning indiana i'm going to pennsylvania i will be all over so we're gonna celebrate for about two hours early in the morning i get up and we begin working again thank you everybody and thank you did not know that i knew i was doing well but i did not know that and i've been a member for a long time and my boys are members and they're much better shooters then i am i'd say they know more about guns that any alternative might be two or three people in this room but believe it or not that many so to get the endorsement believe me is a fantastic honour and and i just said to wane and i just said to chris i will not let you down remember that i will not let you down i wrote a few remarks and i'm gonna actually reading because we go into a little detail but i will tell you that hillary clinton and you know i call a crooked hillary because all you have to do is read any newspaper you one but hillary clinton wants to abolish the second amendment just remember that we're not talking about change it she wants to abolish the second amendment so we're not gonna let that happen i can tell you that right now we're going to preserve it we're going to cherish it we're going to take care of it ok you know they keep chipping away they talk about the magazines they talk about the bullets we're gonna we're going to take care of it you know a couple of things before i give you some more detailed remarks i i feel really happy with what's going on you know the fox ball came out three days ago and in the fox paul i'm leading hillary 41 44 44 and last night resolution which is a highly respected poll came out from forty to look at hillary clinton 37 so we're doing well now with all that we have a long way to go but if you get every one of your friends to go vote cuz is a big difference you know a lot of the things is a difference and summerside all summer big and by the way we're in kentucky we're gonna put the miners back to work before i forget about that we're gonna put the miners we just left and and i also won kentucky so i love kentucky i used to work in cincinnati for two summers i worked in cincinnati doing a job with my father and i loved i love cincinnati and i'd come over the line and had been kentucky unb you'd be surprised how much i know about kentucky but it's it's an amazing place but i said when i won new york cuz we won new york in a landslide and then pennsylvania maryland and we won everything we were winning everything we went connecticut delaware rhode island and then we went to west virginia and boy did i win did we do well in west virginia wow what all landslides in all of the states i mentioned in every single county in every single state that's called a victory and we won by massive percentages in the sixties and some in the seventies and then of course we went to indiana as you know that was going to be that was going to be the firewall for the other side and it turned out to be a massive victory for us again it didn't hurt that bobby knight came out and said i want rump to win that if you're in indiana and bobby knight endorses you that i guess that's about as good as it gets so i just want to say that i've been watching what's going on and i've been looking at airplanes getting blown up in the air and lots of bad things happening it's just not the same and we're gonna bring it back and we're going to bring it back to a real place where we don't have to be so frightened when we don't have to be so afraid and you know what's happening in the schools and you know what's happening everywhere we're going to bring it back and you folks are gonna be so happy and you can be so proud of your country again just remember he did say one thing that was very interesting he said that hillary clinton is unqualified to be the president of the united states and he said that and it's just you know one of those things she said she suffers from bad judgment than she does you look at so many of her decisions have been bad so i think we're gonna do really really well and i look forward to it i actually look very forward to the debates i'd love the debates i don't know i never debated before in all of a sudden have all these debates and that was a big question mark in my mind i mean how will i do in debate some debating people that were on their national debating teams and all of these top debaters but they never had people interrupting them every other word that say you're a liar liar and they're trying to speak and they can't speak you would have done the same i know a lot of you on it she would have done so i just want to give this and i want to really so important to me i wrote it down and again my sons have been members of the nra for many many years and they're incredible they have so many rifles and so many guns sometimes even i get a little bit concerned as if that's a lot ok but i will tell you they are they know so much about it and really their surrogates a go around and speak and every time they speak to a gun organization or a club where people call me and they say you boys are great boys and boy do they know their business so it's one of those things and that's the way we want it and you know i mentioned so often we talk about paris what we talked about san bernardino and nobody had guns you know paris is probably in the world the toughest place to have a gun the toughest ranch generally but paris in particular and when these dogs walked in thugs you know the press used to call a mastermind right the mastermind we're looking i should that's why people joining that's why they're coming in because the using the word mister not mister my thugs fact i call them the guy with the dirty cap remember the white cap and was filthy dirty this was the mastermind and actually depresses stop using the term they're very dishonest people among the most dishonest i've ever met but they actually stop using the term mastermind because they use that term and then they wonder why are used is going in fighting for isis they don't even know what they're fighting for but i think it's gotten a lot better from that standpoint but if you look at paris a hundred and thirty people killed hundreds of people still in the hospital just horribly wounded can never be the same horribly wounded and these guys came in with you over here and they just stood there in just shot everybody know guns in the other side folks if you would have had guns on the other side of i took a couple of these folks in here some especially where the red caps make america great again i promise there would have been a hundred and thirty people killed and hundreds of people lying in the hospital to this day they might have it might not have happened because if they knew there were guns in the room it might not have happened but if it did you it had bullets going in the opposite direction and believe me the carnage would not have been the same by any stretch of the imagination and i tell thank you i tell the same story in san bernardino here is to people i guess she radicalized him who knows who knows it's a mess we're in a mess of a mess radical islamic terrorism we have a president doesn't mention the words doesn't want to talk about it and if you don't want to talk about it you're never going to solve a very big problem and we're talking a worldwide problem when year we're not talking kentucky we're talking all over the world this is a problem and we have a president doesn't want to mention the name you have san bernardino fourteen people they worked with these two they worked with him they gave them a baby shower they had a baby the people they worked with gave him a baby shower they walked in no guns on the other side they had the guns and they killed 14 people many wounded many in the hospital to this day but they wounded many but they killed 14 of their co-workers and the coworkers thought they were friends so there's something going on now i tell you again same stirring if we had guns on the other side wouldn't have been that way i would if we had guns on the other side it wouldn't have been that and then you have the gun free zones the gun-free zones that's real we had a case you know the about a year and a half ago was the first time really heard of this and where you had the five military people great people one was a master marksman a master with anything he touched having to do with guns weapons anything he touched and they were told this is on a military base trucks on a military base they were told put your guns away gotta put your soldiers these are people that are representing us these are the top of the line is we're five great brave incredible souljah's put your guns away sunday guns are locked up put in a different area the place and is whack job walks in as such shooting and killed all five of gun free zones were thank you that wasn't part of my speech i must be honest with you i don't know i don't know maybe i shouldn't read you what i have here but i would have known teleprompters i want to use them as decided to use them a little bit then not bad you never get yourself in trouble when you use a teleprompter you know the problem is it's too easy we have a president who uses teleprompters it's too easy we should have nine teleprompters speeches only when you're running for president you find out about you when you don't find out about it if so the second amendment is under a threat like never before did hillary clinton is the most anti gun and tie second amendment candidate ever to run for office and as i said before she wants to abolish the second amendment joins to take your guns away she wants to abolish just remembered the nra and the lake hero and he was a great guy charlton heston who many of you know was an incredible guy did battle with the clintons to protect our 2nd amendment the nra has led the fight time and time again to protect our fundamental freedoms this is an amazing group after chris and wayne and all of the people and i've gotten a lot of these are incredible people and they really believe this is it like a job they really really believe and we're all lucky to have people like that i will tell you clinton the supreme court decision dec vs heller upholding the right to keep and bear arms hillary said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment that span that's like what she said about the miners were gonna put the miners in the minds out of business then she goes right then she goes to west virginia how would they i hate to say i 1 kentucky but i one west virginia by even more i really but of course she made that statement after i had already won kentucky we're gonna win we're gonna we're gonna win reagan away if hillary gets to appoint judges in this is really important up defenses number one we have to protect our country defensive economies on everything but without defense we don't have a country and our military as you know it's being decapitated what they're doing to our military is incredible i saw the weekend a documentary on are you know are great airmen and these are people that are flying our jets and they're running out of parts for a fighter jets and he's a fighter pilot cheeser incredible man and they're going to junk yards plane graveyards a call when the planes are their graveyard with all planes and they're taking parts off they cannibalizing the planes are taking parts off the planes and they're putting a month to the judge and i'm saying is this the united that's why don't we have new equipment and a man got up great guy looked as good or better than tom cruise and you know what i'm talking about because that was a great movie and a day said you know i've been in this for 20 years and it used to be so incredible and now it's like a different world the equipment the waves maintained everything it's like a different world and i just have to say just to interrupt what i'm gonna be talking about i have to say we're going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before albert is gonna push us around and by the way as part of that we are going to take care of our great veterans and i have to tell you the proper way to properly everybody thank you if hillary gets to appoint her judges you know one of the biggest and most important reasons to win this time it's very unusual sometimes you get no judges to appoint sometimes you go for years and there's no judges probably they'll be a minimum of scalia who was one of the greats all his positions up great he was great but you have scalia so you have one before you even start assuming and i'm sure that mention the guys are going to be able to hold out i have no doubt about it because we don't want anybody take in that slot but and you'll probably have three it could be for add it could even be five judges so i think in terms of fred and we're talking about a four year period and of course we intend to be there for eight years but will make it so good in florida probably say you don't need to do it any longer mister president but but i can stress it any stronger fashion whoever the next president gonna point from three to five judges and if it's hillary or whoever sob she's allowed to run because you know what what she did with her emails is so criminal is so dishonest is so shocking that she shouldn't be allowed to run but it looks like they're going to let her run and that's ok with me cuz really i do wanna run against her i have to be honest limit if she gets to appoint judges she well as part of it abolish the second amendment and i have to say that would be in my opinion that's what she's going to go for and it's a little like she did with the coal miners she said about you know she's gonna put the coal miners she's gonna put the mines out of business and she went to west virginia and she said well i tried to retract it as she tried to retract it didn't work out too well for her she got really beaten badly hillary wants to disarm vulnerable americans in high-crime neighborhoods whether it's a young single mom and a florida or a grandmother in ohio hillary wants them to be defenseless once to take away any chance they have of survival and by the way you have men and you have women sitting in an apartment and outside his tremendous crime tremendous crime of all kinds and they need to be protected and you know the only way they're going to be able to protect themselves and if you take that gun away from them it's going to be very unfair situation and that's why we're going to call her heartless hillary we can do without them i'd rather like somehow i like i put forth and you probably saw it a few days ago i put forth a list of judges who will protect and defend all of our freedoms including the second amendment the judges will follow the constitution and these were all highly vetted the federalist society heritage some great references from jeff sessions are fantastic man from each and from a whole group of people and we put down 11 i'll be adding some additional names over a period of the next month or so sometime prior to the convention hope you can all go to the convention hope you can come and we're gonna be putting some additional names and i think you'll be very happy with them but it's got it's been reviewed incredibly well people love these people and i thought i do that cuz i really think it brings the party together it really is going to admin the effect it's had his incredible cuz they weren't you will prompt a point this one that one how will the judges be such an important thing so i put together the list with some incredibly important organizations and highly respected and everybody's really happy you've seen we've gotten a plus reviews on that now i'd like to call for hillary clinton to put together a list also ok let her put together a list because i'd like to see what that was consistent and you will see its day and night ok day and night and it will not be good for the people in this room and won't be good by the way for the people of our country most importantly so americans use guns to defend themselves against violent crime more than a million times a year ok more than a million times a year and they want to take him away heartless hypocrites like the clintons want to take this and they want to get rid of guns and yet they have bodyguards and have guns so i think that in addition to calling for them to name judges will also call them and let their bodyguards immediately disarm ok you know they should immediately disarm and let's see how good they do let's see how they feel walking around without their guns on their bodyguards in the meantime nobody else can have the guns right president obama tried to take the guns from law-abiding americans but his reduced prosecution's of violent criminals who use guns president obama is even releasing violent criminals from the jails including drug dealers and those with gun crimes and they're being let go by the thousands by the thousands many of these are also i'm sure you're not going to be surprised to hear this illegal immigrants president obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that release thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians i won't tell you i've really learned a lot about the border in fact two weeks ago you probably saw 16,500 border patrol agents endorse donald trump and we've gotten rid of the us needs to have the endorsement from nra today and you have the endorsement from the border patrol agents and i was talking to them these are incredible people the one to do their job that's why they're endorsing me they could just sort of you know they're told to stand back don't do what they want to do their job these are incredible people so first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate and release the violent criminals from jail he wants them all released she wants people released that you wouldn't want to walk on the street with you 110 look at and you know whether it's kate in san francisco you see what happened there or jimmy oh i become great friends with his father jimmy was shot in the face three times by somebody that wasn't supposed to be here or and i always say this because this was a tragic a 65 year old veteran a woman who was a great woman raped sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant wasn't supposed to be here we're gonna straighten out and by the way this doesn't have to do with guns per se but maybe it has to do with a lot of other things were going to build a wall going to be a great wall borders again people are going to come into the country but they're coming into the country legally that coming only way to keep our borders open and i'll tell you what they're gonna be open when people come in legally now hillary want to just keep up with anybody can come across and that's what's been happening and the crime is violent and a lot and lots of other things are happening with the drugs pouring occurrence so she's putting the most vulnerable americans in jeopardy and this is a risk that we can no longer afford we've had enough i think we've had enough would you say we've had like in trying to overturn the second amendment hillary clinton is telling everyone and every women living in a dangerous community that she doesn't have the right to defend herself she have a woman living in a community rough community bad community sorry you can't defend you say that is so unfair and that is so egregious and i'll tell you what my poll numbers with women's study to go up i never thought of it this should really starting to go i will say my poll numbers with men are through the roof but i like women more than men come on women let's calm and most people know that about the most people know this is the most basic human right of all but hillary wants to strip it away and stripping away from women at all others hillary clinton will release violent criminals from jail more so that even obama she is a more open policy that obama if that's possible and put innocent americans at risk i'm going to put criminals behind bars and guarantee that law abiding americans have the right to self thank you there thirteen million right to carry permit holders in the united states i happened to be one of them in the past nobody knows what a nice surprise somebody if they hit it and why was it if i was surrounded by like the largest group of secret service people who by the way are fantastic people had our police are fantastic fantastic people we have to give a standing ovation to our families are fantastic people amazing they do such a great job there so unfairly treated but they know and they know how the people feel about of thank you that's great in the past thirty years the number of right-to-carry states has gone up seven fold these are among the most law abiding folks statistically in the entire country should have the right to carry their among the most like you know they do statistics on everything right everything and these are among the most likely in fact there like at the top of the list in florida for example they've issued more than three million concealed carry permits in the past thirty years only one hundred and sixty eight had been revoked that's point zero zero six percent so very very few and just no difficulty hillary wants to go into the opposite direction she said that president obama didn't go far enough 180 executed this order when he signed this order and he's not going far enough he's gone so far he's gone too far we're gonna stop it and we will unsigned lots of different things including some of those terrible executive orders believe me they're gonna be unsigned so fast they'll be unsigned the first hour that i'm hillary's pledged issue new anti gun executive orders you know that this is the behavior i mean you could save a dictator this is the behavior of somebody frankly i think that doesn't know what she's doing she's not equipped to be president in so many different ways but this is the thinking of a person that is not equipped to be the president of the united states believe me she doesn't understand it bad judgment we talked about it got bad judgment you know where it came from came from me it also came from his current her current opponent was doing pretty well i'll tell you you talk about a rigged system he wins every week and he keeps losing i think bernie should run as an independent ok i do i would love him to run as an independent then it would be the three of us on stage i love that the second amendment is on the ballot in november the only way to save our second amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named donald trump ok i will tell you i will never let you down i will protect our 2nd amendment i will protect our country our military will be strong our borders will be enforced will get rid of common core which is a disaster will bring will bring education local so important our education is a mess we're gonna get rid of obamacare we're gonna have a great great plan as a substitute obamacare is out of control the new costs as you know they're going to be revealed on november 1st they are going to be through the roof and by the way don't let this happen we'll have to speak to mitch obama is trying to get it delayed till after the election the new cars will be revealed in november first unless he gets it changed now we don't want that to happen they will be so astronomical and i'll show what a total failure and disaster obamacare is we will repeal it and we will replace it with something ok i'll leave we're going to have strong borders and we're going to make the greatest trade deals every country worldwide every country in the world is ripping off our great country like where children like taking candy from a baby our trade deals will be renegotiated we won't be having trade deficits of five hundred billion dollars a year with china anymore folks they won't be taking our jobs out of here and kentucky and lots of other places everyplace they won't be taking our jobs and bringing them into mexico like with nabisco where they leave chicago moving to mexico and so many other countries care companies carrier you take a look at carrier air conditioned just left indiana they're leaving indiana they're moving to mexico that's not happening with me because when they make their air conditioners and they sell them across are now very strong border believe me they're going to pay a tax and they're going to say we're not moving to mexico anymore so simple it's so simple so we're going to have we're going to have great trade agreements we're going to become a strong nation again we're going to save our social security we're gonna save our medicare we're going to be so proud of this country you're gonna be proud of your president but i don't care about that you're going to be proud of your country again and when to start winning again because we don't want anymore we never win we don't win on trade we don't win with the military we can't be dices believe me we're gonna knock the hell out of isis we so we are going to start winning again and i have fun saying it and i said a lot but there's nothing better and some of you have heard him but we are gonna win win win we're gonna win with military we're gonna win at the borders we gonna win with trade we're gonna win at everything and some of you are friends and you gonna call you gonna say mister president please we can't take it anymore we can't wait any more like this mister president you're driving us crazy you're winning too much please mister president not so much and i'm gonna say i'm sorry we're gonna keep winning because we are going to make america great again thank you thank you thank everybody thank you kentucky thank you everybody very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism even her former secret service agent who seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and i will deliver that speech very very soon but today there's only one thing to discuss the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since sep tember eleventh and the worst mass shooting in our country's history so many people since i mean just hard to believe but just so many people dead so many people gravely injured so much carnage such a disgrace sahara is beyond description the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated and they will be forever likewise our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated we express our deepest sympathies to the victims the wounded and their families we mourn as one people for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this thank you our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of our long dose lgbt community they have been through something that nobody could ever experience this is a very dark moment in america's history a radical islamic terrorists targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country we need to respond to this attack in america as one united people with force purpose and determination but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly we're not acting clearly we're not talking clearly we've got problems if we don't get tough and if we don't get smart and fast we're not going to have our country anymore there will be nothing absolutely nothing left the killer whose name i will not use or ever say i was born in afghan of afghan parents who immigrated to the united states his father published support for the afghan taliban regime which murders those who don't share its radical views and they murdered plenty the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here that is a fact and it's a fact we need to talk about we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly we have an incompetent administration and if i'm elected president that will not change i will tell you that will not change over the next four years we have an administration that will not change but if i get in there it's going to change and it's going to change quickly we're going from totally incompetent to just the opposite believe me thank you with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore we have to address these issues head-on i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great scorn and anchor but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so and although the pauses temporary we must find out what is going on we have to do it it will be lifted this band when and as a nation were in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country they're pouring in and we don't know what we're doing the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons now any class it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states and its as he or she deems appropriate hopefully it's he in this case thank you i will use this power to protect the american people when i'm elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats after a full day and by the way we have no choice after full and partial and long really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions remember this radical islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-american i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people christian people jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence this is not just a national security issue it's a quality of life issue if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans women and children gay and straight jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now yeah we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores and is coming with these people folks it's coming we're aborting radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people were letting into america all of the september eleven hijackers were issued visas large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis the boston bombers came here through political asylum the mail shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife the other terrorists from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five fall five fault in just one year according to pew research ninety-nine percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law we admit many more and that's just the way it is we admit many more from other countries in the region and i'll tell you what they share these oppressive views and values we want to remain a free and open society then and if we do then we have to control our borders we have to control and we have to control them now not later right now thank you ok yet hillary clinton from months and despite so many attacks repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday and guess what she will probably say them she sort of has said them but let's see what happens she really has no choice but she doesn't want however she's really been force and she has been forced to say these words she supports and the reason is she supports so much of what is wrong and what is wrong with this country and what's going wrong with our country and our borders she has no clue in my opinion what radical islam is and she won't speak honestly about it if she does in fact no she's in total denial and her continuing reluctance to ever named the enemy broadcast weakness across the entire world true weakness i don't know if you know this but just a few weeks before san bernardino the slaughter that's all it was a slaughter hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam here is what she said exact quote muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism that is hillary clinton so she says the solution is to ban guns they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans abolishing the second amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns no good not going to happen folks not gonna happen not gonna happen she wants to take away americans guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us let them come into the country we don't have guns let them come in let them have all the fun they want i will be meeting with the nra which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror i will be always defending the second amendment yeah thank you the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america and allow it to grow overseas and it is growing in fact hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic in the immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life when it comes to radical islamic terrorism ignorance is not bliss its deadly totally deadly the obama administration with the support of hillary clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have just no intelligence gathering information we need this information so badly and he stopped it we don't have the support we don't have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job they are not being allowed to do their job and they can do it well better than anybody we need a new leader we need a new leader fast thank you they're put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else i refuse to be politically correct i want to do the right thing i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again the days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if i'm elected as president i will give our intelligence community law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks and they don't have those schools now we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none second to none that includes better cooperation between state local and federal officials and with our allies very importantly i will have an attorney general a director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right not like it is right now it's not right we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states in september 11 nearly a year ago the senate subcommittee as president obama's department of justice stay and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states these departments refused to comply nobody even knows why they refused to comply president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since sep tember 11 so important the public has a right to know how these people got here how they came onto this great land why are they here ok ok we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs very simple we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america not complicated every and and just think of this take a look every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases just a single event and just one person can you imagine what they'll do in large groups which were allowing now to come here truly our president doesn't know what he's doing he's failed us and he's failed us badly and under his leadership this situation will not get any better it will only get worse and i've been saying that for a long time each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security in fact clinton state department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas having learned nothing from these attacks she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a five hundred percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country tell me tell me how stupid is that this could be a better bigger more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was all together under the clinton plan you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refuge he's from the middle east with no system to vet them or to receive order to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children not only their children by the way they're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system system - really - screen we're not screening people so why don't we have an effective screening system we don't were being left at all over the world the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here we have cities we have inner cities we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states we don't know who they are they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership in which case they're out of here what i want what i want is common sense i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values that's a choice i put before the american people a mainstream in a great immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interest that's all it is we've got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we've got to do it now because later is too late going to be too late for our country the media talks about homegrown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that's a very very important term a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it our imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it yes there are many radicalize people already inside the country as a result of poor policies of the past but the whole point is that we will be much much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem and that's what they're doing we're letting all of these people hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have for instance the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had and its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father was supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth why would we admit people who support violent hatred hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continued - support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women gays and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values she can't have it both ways she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to impress these same communities how does this kind of immigration make our lives better how does this kind of immigration make our country better why does hillary clinton want to bring people in invest numbers who reject our values why explain ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the l be and lgbt community donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words i will tell you who the better friend is and someday i believe that will be proven out bigley and by the way the lbgt community is just what happened to them is just so said and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is to disgrace to that community i will tell you right now clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women and they murder days i don't want them in our country ok immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities every single one of them america is already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth anybody in the world four times more at least because we don't even know who's coming in and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny not surprisingly wages for our workers haven't budged in almost 20 years you wonder why we get the crowds you wonder why we get this tremendous support you wonder why i've got more votes than any republican in any primary and the history of the republican party take a look at that take a look at your security but take a look at the wages for 18 years they've been stagnant they've even gone down so whether it's a matter of national security or financial security we can't afford to keep on going like this cannot afford it we owe 19 trillion dollars in debt and no longer have any options are communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief this is not an act of offense against anyone it's really an act of defense i want us all all of us to work together we have to form a partnership with our muslim communities we have muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership now the muslim community so importantly they have to work with us they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith i want to fix our schools i want to fix our bridges and our jobs market we're going to have it rock it again we're going to make great trade deals but i want every american to succeed including muslims but the muslims have to work with us they have to work with they know what's going on they know that he was bad they knew the people in san bernardino were bad but you know what they didn't turn them in and we had death and destruction hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens i want to protect our citizens all of our citizens the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault in san bernardino as an example people who know what was going on they know exactly but they use the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it they said all we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don't get in trouble we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what if any is their immigration status we have to know and we have to know fast we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with we need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us and we have an attack and these people have to have consequences big concerts america must do more much more to protect its citizens especially people it also means we must change our foreign policy the decision to overthrow the regime in libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before these actions along with our disasters iran deal have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation-building no more nation-building it's never going to work and by the way we've spent almost five trillion dollars over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been a complete and total disaster were further away now that we were 15 years ago for instance the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya that mission helped unleash isis on a new cotton i've said nato needs to change his focus and stop terrorism we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism since i've raised that criticism and it's okay i've got no credit for it but these are minor details nato has since announced a new initiative front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism yeah ok pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war we've tried it president obama's way doesn't work he gave the world his apology tour we got isis and many other problems in return that's what we got remember the famous apology to our way sorry for everything i'd like to conclude my remarks today by get expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders wherever they come from wherever they were born i don't care all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected yeah thank you ok we're gonna be tough and we're gonna be smart and when to do it right america will be a tolerant and open society america will also be a safe society we will protect our borders at home we will defeat isis overseas we have no choice we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety we will make america rich again we will make america safe again we will make america great again thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you very much everybody donald trump live sand on some college there in manchester new hampshire with a a strong message about the news events of the past 36 hours saying a politically correct response will destroy the united states saying that if we don't get tough and smart it's on us and reiterated his call for what he considers a pause a temporary pause and the admission of refugees from the war torn country of syria and suggesting he would expand that beyond to other countries that have direct links to terrorism i'm bill hemmer just to tick past three o'clock in the afternoon live here in orlando working today for shepard smith here on site call cameras with donald trump to get the car right now and check in on the message and the speech and more from the trump team call good afternoon hi bill well obviously this was a somber and sometimes very angry speech donald trump had planned to decay to deliver a speech i castigating hillary clinton and saying that she was unfit for service and going after a bill of particulars if he thinks that are the offenses they should disqualify her from being the presidency and this was supposed to be a speech that in which he would outline how he would defeat isis and what mr. trump did was complain that the us intelligence services are being hamstrung by president obama and said that president obama is in part by association to blame for all of these things for not having done enough to stop isis already he also criticized hillary clinton time and time again saying that she was weak out of step doesn't understand the problem because she's refused for years to say radical islamic terrorism today actually when asked about her unwillingness to say that in the past she did talk about radical jihadism and radical islamism but she hasn't used the phrase radical islamic terrorism and trump went to town on that again it did become quite critical of hillary clinton and the president and for donald trump who more than a year ago said that he had a quote beautiful plan to fight isis but didn't want to talk about it less everybody either steal the idea in the presidential race and or prepare for it as the terrorists defending themselves against the onslaught from americans trying to stop it didn't get specific today but he did again renew his call for what he calls the temporary ban and said that it would be temporary it would take a while to figure out which countries he was rather specific about this saying that there would be certain countries from which radical terrorism has been shown to be emanating and coming to the u.s. that would have this temporary ban on immigrants he made absolutely no compromise in that he says that that is something that he thinks absolutely has to happen and when he's president implemented bill yeah carl did you hear the comment about he accused the terrorists of being an afghan i do believe was the words that that trump used they're born to afghan parents all the information we have today is that he was born in new york now i have you seen a transcript of the speech did i did i hear him say that or was it definitely didn't for you know he did he did say that actually there is a transcript forthcoming and we'll check it again but the words that he used perhaps if you misread it from the transcript but he suggested that the the shooter was in fact born in afghanistan and what noted that the shooters father at one point was a print was a candidate for president of that country so uh perhaps his fax or a little bit wrong or perhaps you just misread from the proper this is something that is not had a lot of practice with he's been doing it a lot lately but over the course of the last year it's mostly been off the cuff thank you carl car camera live so i have to tell you a few things numbers just came out just now number one we're doing very well in the polls that's important okay very very well but you know the numbers just came out that during the primary system during the primaries the republicans i wonder why we're up sixty-two percent the democrats were down twenty one percent these are final number system that tells you a little bit a little bit about what's going on and what's going on very big and big league is what you witnessed today and over the last week from bill clinton going to the plane just happened to be there just happened to be there i wonder how long you waited but for bill clinton to go to the plane and then to have what happened today we're essentially i thought everybody thought based on what was being said she was guilty she was guilty and it turned out that we're not going to press charges is it's really amazing but i'll tell you i'll tell you what we have a out we have a rigged system folks hey i used to say it during the primers were all together i won north carolina big league because you giggling and not only did the republican party go way up from what it was four years ago way way up but donald trump in the history of the primary system republican party with 17 people running a lot of people don't understand what you say 17 people i got almost 14 million votes more than anybody in the history of the republican party more than ronald reagan more than the bushes more than richard nixon more than dwight d eisenhower who did with the second world war certainly help the heck of a lot we got the highest vote count in the history of the republican party that was such a big thing for me we won 37 states we were i mean it just got stronger and stronger and stronger and i think we're stronger now than ever before we're fighting a very dishonest media do we have a protester i get we love our protesters don't wait the only time i get the cameras to turn the only time we get those cameras to turn the size of this place this is really great this is really great get him out get him out get him out all right thank you thank you that's all right take it easy take it easy folks you know and i could speak to these people for a little while what do we want when you think of it we want good education we want a strong military we want strong borders we do want the wall we want to keep our jobs in north carolina we want to keep our jobs in north carolina i mean look at what's going on folks we're going to build the wall don't worry who's gonna pay for the wall who's gonna pay i didn't hear you who's gonna pay better believe it could have been they'll be happy to pay if the right person asked some they're going to be happy to pay no problem if the wrong person like crooked hillary clinton asked him they're not going to pay but she's never going to ask she's never gonna ask and i'll tell you what when it comes to trade and i just got a list of companies that have left north carolina and they got down to mexico and it's it's a disgrace what's what's happening it is a disgrace what's happening and we're going to stop it and it's not going to happen any longer we're losing our jobs we're losing our manufacturing we're going to stop the nonsense that's going on and it's so easy to stop we will stop it so fast your head will spin remember that your heads will spin so we'll talk a little bit about trade later it's so easy to trade is so easy folks it's so easy the trade of all of them we're going to knock the hell out of isis we have by the way by the way we have a president who was out campaigning for crooked hillary clinton and he should be home working on isis where the threat is getting worse and worse he should be working on trey he should be working on the border's people flowing into our country from lots of places but from syria no more no more ok they're not coming no more we don't know who they are we r know where they come from they have no documentation they have no paperwork and who knows who knows but you know what we can't take any more chances folks we can't take any more chances if you look at if you look at crooked hillary she wants to increase the immigrants coming in from syria again they could be isis think this could be this could be the all-time great trojan horse you know the story of the trojan horse this could be the all-time great look at what one person one person has done in orlando just take a look one person look at that the horror that that person has reached on our country the gay community the lgbt community was just they cannot nobody can even fathom what took place that's one bad apple we have many people coming in and you know what it just takes a small percentage but there's something going on and guess what we have a leader that doesn't even want to discuss the name of the probable and the problem is radical islamic terrorism and it's a problem yeah and we've got hillary clinton whose week who's ineffective she'll never be able to do the job her judgment is horrible look at her judgment on emails who would do it look at her judgment her judgment is horrible all right her judgment is horrible now who said that about hillary bernie sanders said her judgment is bad she's got bad judgment ok now let me tell you whether it's isis whether its trade whether its borders whether it's jobs it's going to be four more years of the same thing the last thing we need is another plantin or the last thing we need is an obama clinton in the white house we have got a mess in this country we are 19 trillion dollars soon to be 21 trillion the dead has doubled under obama it's doubled way do you see we are sitting on a mess and it's got to be taken care of and the way it gets taken care of at least that aspect of it is jobs we're going to bring jobs back to north carolina we're going to bring jobs back to our country it's going to be america first not all these are the countries that don't give a damn about us it's going to be america first america america america first yeah yeah yeah yeah we've got a person in the white house that's having a lot of fun a lot of fun i watched him today it's like a carnival act lot of fun moving around is the whole thing you know great great great i'm saying this is a president we need a president who is going to bring us back we need a president that's not going to be divisive we need a president that's going to take care of the african-american community remember that remember that obama is all talk and no action we need a president that's going to create jobs for hispanics who don't have the jobs we need a president that's going to turn our country around and obama cannot do it and hillary clinton will be even worse believe me she will be even worse i mean i brought up something last night i heard they're flying down an air force one now air force one is a very old boeing 747 it sucks up a lot of gas a lot of fuel for the fuel bill you turn on those engines i can tell you a lot of money i said let me ask you question why is she campaigning with the plane of the united states why is she campaign and why is he allowed to come down get on that very very very expensive plane you know he talks about the carbon footprint ok he wants to solve the carbon footprint but he gets on an old the boeing 747 that's viewing stuff into the air he gets her on the plane we will fight environment we will fight for the carbon footprint that he gets back into the boeing 747 goes back to wash his greatest his greatest was what he wanted to play golf in hawaii so he takes the 747 by the way he's played more rounds just about people that played professionally on the pga - i mean this guy and he gets on this plane flies hawaii he's there for a long time golf golf golf got more more learning how to chip learning how to hit the dr learning at a pot i want more our country is going to hell isis is laughing at is there chopping off heads they're drowning people in steel cages and he's out there playing golf with just about as long a trip as you can make from washington then after a long extended vacation he gets back on the plane flies back lands starts talking about the environment ok give me a break folks gives me a break here be output now you know we need unity of the republican party and i have to be honest i think i went without the unity but we need unity of the republican party and for the most part we have unity we have some pretty good stuff and we have some great people like bob who just came up and so many others so many senators so many congressmen and women we have great people but we need real unity and the leaders have to get supportive and if they don't get supportive we're gonna win anyway don't worry about fact probably i do better without the kind of support that we're talking about because that's where i'm here in the first light that's why i'm here in the first place the convention is going to be terrific we have great speakers we have fantastic speakers we have so many people that want to speak you know they give us of all they don't have enough we have so many people that want to speak i have made so many enemies by saying i can't let you do it but we want people that love our country and i want to be there and that love our party party and if they don't love our party they shouldn't be there and let me just tell you one little thing which turns out to be a big big thing defense is always most important right we have to defend our country we're gonna have to build up our military again it's really depleted it's in bad shape we're going to build it up we're going to take care of our vets like you wouldn't believe because our vets are being mistreated horribly horribly our greatest people and we have a plan that's received universal fantastic reviews and i'm the only one you know i made a speech up in great part of the world okay i won't even mention where but i made a speech and during the speeches and let's raise the money for the myths we ended up raising 5.6 million dollars for events ok i gave a million and we ended up i can't he just made a speech and left and the press comes down well you should give it here we should give it faster said we have to vent the vets you know that right there groups who knows we have to check them out but anyway we raised 5.6 million dollars of that i am so proud of it i love the vets i have received more accolades from the groups with any groups that never had money a hundred thousand two hundred thousand and one case 1.1 million in another case - 50 70 5050 faster all of these groups i don't know 30-something groups it was so beautiful to see i you all of us we have received accolades and i say all of us because this is a movement folks this is not like a normal situation look at this room look at the size of this world and there are thousands of people and i got wiped out getting off the plane it was raining and windy and i want to tell you sexy beautiful beautiful and now you know it's my hair because any hair that could withstand that with the pilot it is my hair the pilots all right wait about 10 to 20 minutes before you get out of the plane i said why is it 35 40 mile-an-hour gusts raining i said no we gotta keep we're not going to keep a fair ball force he announces to the world he's gonna take everybody out and we'll be out by a certain date and the only thing that was a little surprising is the enemy didn't believe them because they said nobody could be that stupid to announce that we're gonna be out for a certain date and then that day came and we were gone we were gone we should have been there we shouldn't have destabilized saddam hussein was a bad guy right he was a bad guy really bad guy but you know what he did well he killed terrorists he did that so good they didn't read the rights that he talked they were terrorists was over today iraq is harvard for terrorism you want to be a terrorist you go to iraq it's like harvard ok so said so i said okay so soon and we'll take care of it folks we have no choice we have no choice it was when they cut off the heads initially we were all amazed i think they overplayed their hand and if they didn't then we are all fools because we cannot let them get away with what they're doing right now terrorizing the world we're going to be so struggle but it's so tough we're going to be so vicious and we're gonna knock them for a loop so i just wanna i wrote some notes coming in the plan because i was watching this tragedy that took place today and over the last few days it's a tragedy because we're a country of law were country of water other people have been so badly hurt by doing things so much less than crooked hillary clinton so much less right so much less i mean you look at so many people have suffered so greatly for doing so much less now does that mean that we expunge their record does that mean that we say all of you people that have been so guilty for so many years we can no longer accept that as a ruling because what we've done for her and she was so much worse than anybody that we're talking about does that mean that we have to exonerate everybody we have to take back the punishment that we gave them because we have a country that supposed to be fair and when you hear what was said by the fbi director today and you listen you listen to what he said and in the middle of it he was talking about so many different things he talked about extremely careless she was extremely careless that's a tremendous word you didn't have to be careless you don't even have to really know that what you were doing was wrong and you're guilty because we talking about serious stuff we're talking about the lifeblood of our country we're talking about the safety of our people the laws are very explicit stupidity is not a reason that you're going to be innocent ok it's not really yeah yeah and i don't happen to believe that was civility ok but even stupidity is not a reason and boy what they've done so i wrote this out and i'm going to read some of it to you and i think it makes sense and i think it's important for us to understand today is the best evidence ever that we've seen that our system is absolutely totally rigged it's rick yeah and i use that term initially when i was running in the republican primaries and i was the first to use it then all of a sudden it became a hot term everybody was using the word great great great but if you remember i'd way to louisiana and i find out i didn't get enough delegates what happened and places like colorado which was so good to me but all of a sudden we find out that they don't have the vote and other things ok i use the word creek and frankly i'll be honest if i didn't win in a landslide i wouldn't be standing up here you'd be watching some politician who would lose the hillary clinton ok pull it pull it i started when i learned about rig very fast i learned but i use the term break then all of a sudden bernie started using it and other people now everyone talks about rick but i'm going to keep using it because i was the one that brought it up and i'm the one and i asked a couple of political approach you ever hear the word read it's a rig everything and they really it's that hasn't been a thing is i guess it has to be somewhere along the line but it hasn't but think of bernie sanders who is the most angry about this i think the one with the most to lose is bernie sanders because honestly he was waiting for the fbi primary and guess what he just lost today the fbi primary he lost the fbi primary burning my poor birdy birdy i feel so badly for birdie but you know what a lot of bernie sanders supporters are going to be voting for trump because bernie sanders was right yeah 30 sanders was right about a couple of things he's right about the system being rigged but he's also right about trade our trade deals are a disaster they're killing our jobs to killing our families they're killing our incomes i mean people in this room many people in this room and i'm gonna fight because it's going to be changed fast many people in this room are making less money today then they made 18 years ago effectively and they're working two jobs instead of one and as horrible stupid obamacare is a killer which is giving a part-time employment well they never had part-time employment in their lives and the premiums are through the roof and the deductibles are so high that you'll never be able to use it unless you die a very vicious long slow death ok and it's going to explode in 17 anyway and we're going to replace it before it explodes and we're going to replace it with something that's great and that's less expensive both for yourselves and for the country it's it's a horror show is that you have to see that the what i'm hearing in texas going through obamacare blue cross blue shield raised sixty percent you saw that last with a sixty percent increase in premiums blue cross blue shield through obamacare now i hear that our november first they're going to have an increase or obamacare and health care that is going to set this country in motion and i mean motion in a bad way november first so what obama wants to do because it's actually election defying its election changing the numbers are bigger than texas sixty percent the numbers are astronomical and what they want to do is they don't want to take those numbers and move them from november first to any time after the election and we're not gonna let him get away with it folks we're not gonna let him go so as i said today is the best evidence we've ever seen that our system is totally rigged hillary clinton put the entire country in danger put the entire country in danger and benghazi and then goes and plenty of other things by the way it was confirmed today that you routinely send classified emails on an insecure private server that could be easily hacked by hostile foreign agents and we learned that people she emailed were hacked and drive ibly i think maybe definitely were hacked by these hostile actors and he's a bit but very very smart people a hell of a lot smarter than what we have in washington that it continue penalties may have a blackmail file on crooked hillary and this alone means that she should not be allowed to serve as president of the united states yeah we now know just wrote this out we now know that she lied to the country when she said she did not send classified information on her service he life yeah she said vast amounts of classified information including information classified as top secret top secret ok and this is where they said that she was extremely careless and frankly i say grossly incompetent she will be such a lousy president folks so said okay the lives of the american people were put at risk by hillary clinton so that she could carry on her corrupt financial dealings probably that's probably why she didn't want people to see what the hell she was doing she went to extraordinary lengths to carry out and end rhyme so purge of her emails thirty-three thousand emails are missing and they say oh she's fine she's fine 33,000 and i've always been told you can't really get rid of an email have you ever heard this that if we have the real super geniuses that know this stuff they say you can't get rid of emails but we didn't use them because they didn't want to use them they didn't want to use them so like a criminal with a guilty conscience clinton had her lawyers delete destroy and wipe away forever except i still say they're geniuses that can find him 30 thousand think its 30,000 emails this again this qualifies her from service and just thinking that i mean how can you have this yeah we know now that these deletions included emails that were work related one more big fat beautiful lie by crooked hillary any government employee who engage in this kind of behavior would be barred from handling classified information again that alone disqualify her and again bernie sanders talked about bad bad i drink tonight folks because now it looks like it's over for birdie but you know what i have a feeling they're gonna have a lot of people marching on philadelphia let's see what happens ok let's sit i don't know about you but i always felt that hillary clinton would escape criminal charges for a dangerous and illegal behavior because open back this deep that it to pick up a bit a bit if that what that yeah yeah so the ag met with the president had to before the announcement i mean how about that met with president built on how about that deal right he's waiting around he's waiting at the airport all - all look the ag's got oh let me go say hello 39 minutes i'm going to talk about the grandkids got to i hear they're beautiful i hear the beautiful get to now i have eight grandchildren and i will tell you i can talk about and after i say is it's beautiful isn't it beautiful i love this i love the kid i loved it but after about a minute i can't go much longer i want to get the business right for you i want to get the business but he didn't talk about he talked about golf ok so we talk about the grandkids and i would say that would take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute seriously i am i right and make it up how long did your dog mr. attorney general i have the most beautiful grandchildren you've ever seen let me show you a picture is not great let me show you another picture what do you think i think they're beautiful aren't they get and they're smart and they're great they're great now he's starting to run out of words that's 30 seconds ok now - okay got it i don't know about girls that he does you can talk about girls that like it just hey jack nicklaus is the greatest the greatest right yes tiger once tiger coming back adam scott's wonderful he wanted to ral we love adam scott phil mickelson we love when you told you can't talk much longer a couple of minutes okay i don't think they went over the swing the technique or anything right places too small right so so so give the grandchildren two minutes give the gulf three and a half minutes is a long time to be sitting there twiddling your thumbs what else are we gonna talk about let's talk about hillary let's talk about hillary did you see today hillary announced that she may consider the attorney general i'm not casting aspersions on anybody other than hillary of course but she may consider the attorney general who is ruling on a case now now they're ruling in the case to continue forward as attorney general now how do you make that statement when they are going to rule because remember what happened the fbi makes their recommendation and then still it's up to the attorney general's office so hilary said today at least according to what i saw on television which you can't always believe i actually found it hard to believe she'd say this but she said today that we may consider the attorney general to go forward that's like a bribe is that sort of a bride i think it's a bribe yeah i mean that if she wins she's going to consider extending the attorney general and and you know what i'm saying i've been knocking the attorney general what i'm saying is how can you say that it's a bride i mean the attorney general sitting there saying you know if i get hillary off the hook i'm going to have four more years or eight more years but if she loses i'm out of a job it's a bribe it's a disgrace it's a disgrace she is laughing at the stupidity of our system she is laughing and so is her husband bill laughing and what's going on because lemon and a pen there before you know they've been there between white water and all of the others they've been there look at our cattle futures mean she did better with cattle proportionately then people that have been in the cattle business all their lives that have made millions in the cattle she did better than they did and she never did it before i wonder how that happened and now with all of that going on you have obama campaigning and he's campaigning and this was set up a long time ago and he know that the fbi was going to do this because it would have been very uncomfortable for him to campaign with her actually if they didn't take a pass on crooked hillary so they take a pass they announced they're not going to press charges lo and behold a few hours later let's have a press conference let's do a speech together by the way her speech or speech for speech was terrible i watched it how boring was that speech do we like drunk better do you like some now let me just tell you let me just tell you because the word temperament comes in you see says he's got a very strong temperament i guess they just chopping off heads losing thousands and thousands and thousands of people to these savage animals right we need somebody with a tough peppermint it's time and i'll tell you whether its own trade whether it's on military whether it's at the border the last person these other countries want to see as president of the united states because i'm going to be fighting for you not fighting for them i'm going to be fighting for you is donald j trump the last person yeah so the last night yeah yeah so a very amazing and prestigious man i won't use his name but some people were no i'm talking about i was at his house and he said donald i thought you were totally wrong i thought you are much too tough on china i thought you were much too tough on japan i thought you were much too tough on mexico and all of these other countries that you're talking to with respect but i thought you were much too tough and for a year i've been telling people he's being too tough i thought you are much too tough donald on saudi arabia much too tough i thought you are much too tough on japan because as you know and as you never knew before i got involved we pay for a big portion of japan's military and i want them to help us out this isn't 40 years ago this is in 30 years ago this any cars to us by the millions and believe me we don't need more on iran deals done by incompetent people we need smart people we need great negotiators and believe me i'll head up and i know what i'm doing but we have the greatest negotiators in the world and we don't use them we use political hacks so we take care of japan and we take care of germany and we take care of lots of places south korea we have 28 thousand soldiers on the line between north and south korea south korea order television see if you can buy one of the united states you know the answer is you can't or other things many other things see if you can buy him hey who just moved to mexico right who just moved to mexico from indiana the great state of indiana they gave me another great victory right carrier so we don't make that anymore so carrie is moving by the way i would tell the people carrier love you people every time you make an air conditioning unit and enjoy your beautiful factory you're gonna send it through that border which is now a very strong and secure border and you're gonna pay thirty-five percent tax and you know what they're not leaving they're not leaving from they're not going to leave yeah now hillary clinton won't say that and i'll tell you the press doesn't treated right one person actually at the new york times david sanger traded it right along with maggie they wrote a story that was pretty accurate about a two percent but i mentioned this all the time and the press will go donald trump once japan to go nuclear i said that you have to be prepared always in a deal to walk for instance with the horrible deal we made with iran the horrible do the incompetent he'll carry should have picked up and walked a couple of times he should have walked when they said they won't get back our hostages until the deal is off we should've walked and then he should have walked doubled up the sanctions and by the time they landed back in the united states that could turn the plane around you would have those sausages back instead of waiting for years and he should have said one other thing folks we gave them back 150 billion dollars i would have said it differently i would have said you know my father you say son you're too tough take the lumps out soft nice and easy my father was great good salesman good building he left to build houses script i learned so much from and he was a great guy loving i love my father but he uses a son son you too tough take the lumps out so in the old days i would've said we are giving you the hundred and fifty billion dollars and they would have been angry and we would have had lots of problems right i wouldn't say that way anymore my father taught me - well i want to set felis and it is all fell as i hate to say they haven't figured out that the women is more than the men yet okay they were they will it will take about a hundred and fifty to two hundred more years but they're gonna figure it out okay then we're really in trouble can you imagine because the persians are great negotiations and they totally out negotiate so i want to sit fellows don't be afraid we have a problem we have a bad budget that was just passed the omnibus budget disaster we're going up to 21 trillion dollars and then we don't have the money i'm sorry i apologize i won't be able to pull it off i'm not going to be able to give you the hundred and fifty billion dollars back i can't do it i wanted to i wanted to do it so bad and you're right you should get it you should get it off you're right but we don't have the money i'm sorry and they'll go crazy and then we leave and we say that hell with them double up the sanctions again and i'll say will drop 250 billion we have rank amateurs daily for us i have the greatest business men in the world carl icahn many endorsing me we're gonna bring so much back we have right now i say it's five trillion dollars the government is two and a half trillion but it's a lot in other places in other areas across the seas that we want to bring that my tax plan which cuts taxes for everybody by the way including business and middle class in particular it cuts taxes we're going to bring all that money back and that money is going to be spent in the united states right now they can't get their money back so you have corporate inversions you have companies leaving the united states to get their money they can't get their money back it's impossible bureaucratically and the taxes are so ridiculous that only a person that's really really really dumb would say send it back so they leave the money over there and they take the company they moved the company to the money up here that one before and it's happening all over the place take a look at what's going on and it's going to end it's going to end with one of the highest text nations in the world we're cutting the hell out of taxes were cutting the hell out of these ridiculous regulations which are destroying our businesses destroying our businesses and we're going to do it you ok so just to finish because i'm so proud of what i wrote i have to read it right i love i actually love writing people don't realize you're nobody number one bestsellers like that and the art of the deal i actually know how to write i love reading this stuff i love it the question really has to be asked is this what is hillary clinton's up and to that i'm even going to say who camps she's put as a danger and some people say that it's corrupt financially i don't care what her motive is all i know is she had a motive but she's erased so many males will never find out ok bill and hillary clinton rake in millions of dollars from foreign governments special interest and international corporations in exchange for favors folks for favors she's crooked hillary don't you understand that this is one of the most crooked politicians in history these entities either funneled money into the clinton foundation or paid bill clinton lavishly for speeches compare fortune at least 60 companies that lobby the state department during clinton's tenure as secretary of state donated a total of twenty-six million dollars to the clinton foundation ok 26 million and she's dealing with his country's bill clinton and by the way many of these countries treat women and want to enslave women and they treat women horribly and as far as the gay community they push them off buildings and they kill them and they executed and she has tens of millions of dollars from these countries believe me i am better for the gay community i am better for women then she will ever be on her best day on her best day yeah bill clinton was paid a fortune to deliver a speech in moscow russia while hillary clinton was in charge of the russian reset another disaster bill clinton was paid money by the chinese government a lot and its supporters while hilary handled china policy and during this time china was stealing hundreds of billions of dollars in united states intellectual property okay folks we could go on forever abc news said president clinton accepted speaking fries from numerous companies and individuals with interests pending before hillary clinton's state department oh that's - that's - international business times said governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by clinton state department's have delivered listen to this have delivered her state department she's improving deals have delivered between 54 and 141 million dollars to the clinton found a hundred 41 million now oh wait a week what's going on here to the clinton foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the clinton family then when hillary left the state department she was pay 21.6 million dollars for speeches delivered in less than two years that's not bad 21 million dollars of making speeches and she's a boring speaker is terrible i think what i could make all man when i mean she's a terrible speaker she got 21.6 million dollars for speeches and she refuses because bernie sanders nose is better than anybody she refuses to give up the text of the speeches i don't know what's in there hey i don't care if he gives it up because i understand and i understand many of the people that are her supporters and by the way many of my friends of mine and they got owned her folks they can all don't forget i used to be on the other side of the equation i used to be establishment then on during the 16th iran and everyone said huh he's no longer establishment he's not supposed to be running he doesn't need our money that's terrible and i put up 55 million dollars approximately in the primers and one big league and then i'm putting up money now but i'm raising a lot of money for the party and it's good it's good it's really good we're gonna win this thing we're going to take this country back from these feeds and these scripts and he's horrible president these phony presidents and i mean it when i say what obama can take all of this time off when you have bombings all over the place and you have isis as an example and all of the bad deals when he can't take that kind of time off to spend it with hillary clinton with the seal of the president in front as she stands there she doesn't look presidential to me folks i can tell you that she doesn't look president hillary also had reason to hide her foreign policy disasters and his decisions that went into them her push for regime change in libya egypt and syria has been a total and complete disaster her iraq policy has been catastrophic she's unleashed isis across the middle east with her bed decisions and her bed judgment and she's going to do nothing about it because she's a weak weak person she doesn't have the strength and she doesn't have the temperament believe me just going to be more of the same folks more of the same in 2009 before she took office libya was cooperating syria was under control iraq was seeing a reduction in violence and iran was big joke absolutely choke financially they were dying now after she left isis controls huge portions of iraq syria and libya committing unspeakable inhuman atrocities and trying to launch attacks against the west iran me well has been placed on the path to nuclear weapons has become a true power they become a true power in the middle east and beyond what they were in power we gave them power with that horrible horrible deal so hillary clinton's policies have spread isis and made a ran the dominant islamic power in the middle east hillary clinton can't keep her email safe and you know what folks she sure as hell can't keep our country safe can't do it yeah so i want to thank the people of north carolina it's been such an amazing it's been such an amazing wrong thing it's such an amazing we've had a lot of good times you had a lot of fun we've had a lot of speeches we've had a lot of good times together though seriously and luck we need change that obama change remember obama is good we need change it sounds so good everybody thought and i actually thought he'd be a cheerleader for the country i thought he'd be chillin and he's really turned out to be a very divisive person ok we need to change and i hate to use the term but we really do need change we need fresh tough bold ideas we need people that know what they're doing we need people that aren't worried about political correct this we can't use that term we can't use that yeah yeah yeah and i watched obama a week ago spend a whole speech i'm talking about why he shouldn't necessarily have to say radical islam why he shouldn't do it that's what the problem is and he doesn't even know it i don't even think you know honestly folks i don't think he has a clue i don't think he knows what the hell is going blonde ok i don't think he knows what's going on and you know it's a very interesting thing but i was watching yesterday and everybody say isis isis isis isis now you know you can have your definition has to do with territory and has to do with other things that we can both give your definitions of isis and isil but you ever notice people services except him he says isil myself because and i so is being driven back and i saw is the jv remember that the jv man if that's the jv i sure as hell don't want to see the varsity right don't worry don't worry if i win they'll be the jv and then they go down to first grade pretty soon folks but he says i saw and you know it's almost like he does it to make people upset i had so many people and what did you just say yes forgetting about definitions and actually some friends of mine that are very very good on the subject say isis is actually more accurate but who knows what everybody says isis say will be something that's right right to say is that i soul will be driven back you know it's always i soul will be driven back in the meantime it's a decision it's totally a disaster remember this and i said it before our military is depleted at a time when probably in the history of this country we need strong military we are going to win north carolina yeah we are going to get rid of these fools these fools that are running our country they're fools we are not going to pick up four more years that even the fbi today talk so horribly about this person to a point where you said how can you possibly say no charges what they said that what to do ha but you've been at your head of the supreme court who's here these are great people with great great where are they are they around yourself like they're here stand out come on stand up beautiful he's a great he's a great great people with great reputation i will take the outside of north carolina family reputation is okay and you're lucky capitola video we're going to start winning again we're gonna win at every level we're gonna win with our military we're going to take care of our vets and we're going to really take care of our events and it's not even a question of money it's a quite put it at be simple it's a right the what one would think oh and two fronts so we're going to start winning we're going to win on the second amendment we're not going to let people take our guns away we're going to terminate common core out of washington we're going to bring our education local local so we can have our local people who love our children and who really understand our children give them the kind of education that we want we're going to repeal and replace obamacare so quickly something we're going to create strong strong borders we're going to build our wall we're going to stop drugs from flowing into our country like water it's flowing into our country like water we're going to protect our state's we're going to protect our youth and others from the drugs that are flowing through the southern border we are going to make the greatest trade deals anyone's ever made we're going to bring our jobs back we're going to bring manufacturing back we're going to be selling things to other countries we're not going to let countries come in and take advantage of us take our company's out sell their goods with no tax with no nothing and then when our manufacturers want to go to china and other places to sell their goods they can't get their goods into the country because the chinese said we don't want you good so they dumped onto our land and they dump their steel and they dump their aluminum and they destroy our factories and they destroy so much and you know what folks we're going to end up doing our own products largely again and you know what let me tell you our products and i am not for isolation this is only if they don't behave but they devalue their currency they make it impossible for our companies to compete every time we start to do well various countries that are grandmasters they start to valuing their currencies and our country's go from boy i'm feeling good today - oh here we go again you can't compete it's cheating it's a big form of cheating we are going to take care of our manufacturers and we're going to start making product again and let me tell you something we may pay a little more for the product but we could have all those jobs that make the product in the long run we're going to be much better off much better and a lot of that will come back and again no isolation we're going to have a fair trade we're going to have free trade one of these people sitting right up there sp the other day what do you do you call it fair trade you call it free trade it's all good i can give you ten different names the train here's what i call it we're gonna make great deals for our country and give it's fair if it's free i don't get there one of this we're going to make great deals ok we're not going to let happen what's been happening so folks where to start winning again we're going to win so much you're gonna be so sick of me you're going to have the justice call me you're gonna have the lieutenant governor and the governor call me and say mr. president that people of north carolina are sick and tired of winning you're winning too much they're really starting to dislike you mr. president and i'm going to tell the justice and i'm going to tell the governor and the lieutenant governor i'm sorry we've got to keep winning because we're going to make america great again i love you north carolina thank you very much thank you thank you thank you very much everybody ah thank you what a great group thank you very much well i'd like to thank chairman jeff miller is terrific guy and on behalf of all of those who have served this country in military uniform and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our truly great veterans thank you very much chef i appreciate it before going further today however i'd like to first address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform thank you police officer shoes we love our police officers thank you that's very nice thank you are police officers rush into danger every single day to protect our communities and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism they serve thousands of lives every year performed countless public services every day and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report but i want our nation's police to know that we thank you from the bottom of our heart yeah and we support you and we will always always always stand with you the attack on our dallas police is an attack on our country our whole nation is in mourning and will be for a very long time yet we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty very big rise america's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos and the destruction of our country as we know it we must remember the police are needed the most where crime is the highest politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable americans it's time for a hostility against our police and against all members of law enforcement to end and end immediately right now we went through an ugly chapter in our history during vietnam when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas for too many police today that is their daily reality at the same time the tragic deaths in louisiana and minnesota make clear that the work must be done to ensure and a lot of work that americans feel that their safety is protected have to do it we have to get better better sharper smarter we were all disturbed by the images that we saw we must discuss as well the ongoing stress trophy of crime in our inner cities our inner cities are rife with crime according to the chicago tribune there has already been more than 2,000 2,000 shooting victims in chicago alone this year this epidemic of violence destroys lives destroys communities and destroys opportunity for young americans violent crime has increased in cities across america the new york times described the startling rise and murders in our major cities brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into virginia and maryland too many americans are trapped in fear violence and poverty our inner cities have been left totally behind and i'm going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home a safe school and a safe community yeah yeah we must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country one hundred percent we will cease to have a country hillary clinton on the other hand is weak ineffective and during and as proven by her recent email scandal which was an embarrassment not only to her but to the entire nation as a whole she's either a liar or grossly incompetent one of the other very simple personally it's probably both not only am i the law and order candidate but i'm also the candidate of compassion believe it the candidate of compassion but you can have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of our country every kid in america should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood without harm everyone will be protected equally and treated justly without prejudice we will be tough we will be smart we will be fair and we will protect all americans without safety we have nothing it's the job of the next president to make america safe again for everyone everyone that promise of protection must include taking care of every last veteran which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the horrible attack in dallas the men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of america now is the time to follow their example of unity public service and selfless devotion to a nation we made a promise and we have to honor the promise that we made to these great heroes you defend america and america will defend you yeah yeah thank you i but that promise has been broken by our politicians like so many other promises our country has made not only to its veterans but two its citizens as a whole president obama has allowed our veterans affairs health care all systems really denied them to help and the support and willie has to do it we have to get on the ball we have to do it right hillary clinton recently said of the va scandal that it's not been as widespread as it's been made out to be that's a quote she actually thinks that the veterans health administration is well run that's because she's been part of this rig system for a long time perhaps it's easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they're being paid millions of dollars to read a teleprompter speeches to wall street executives instead of spending time with real people in real pain the disconnect the disconnect in america's deep there are two americas the ruling class and the groups that favors and then everyone else the va scandals that have occurred on this administration's watch are widespread and totally inexcusable an internal memo from the senior va officials describes quote lawlessness and chaos at the veterans health administration including the payments of six billion dollars a year in violation of federal contracting rules the memo also says they waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws and warns that these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to america's great veterans and you know it and you sing even the white house's own deputy chiefs f described quote significant and chronic systemic failures in veterans affairs including a corrosive culture that has led to personal problems across the department with poor management and a history of retaliation against employees who raised issues and very good issues he said he said there is a lack of accountability across all grade levels on that is correct 40 veterans just as an example have died waiting for karen things 40 different va facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times a va employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff as was a convicted sex offender the va i spent eight million dollars on solar panels good old solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be tearing it down in the very near future the st. cloud minnesota va built a 2.3 million dollar wind turbine in april that hasn't supplied power since 2012 can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full thank you thank you most of those responsible have still not been held to account fixing this corruption will be one of my many and really highest priorities and believe me it will happen i'm really good at things like that it will be fixed and that begins with a simple promise every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care every day yeah veteran should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctrine clinics weather at a va facility or at a private medical center we must extend this right to all veterans not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days or live more than 40 miles from the va hospital which is unfortunately the current and wrong policy this promise includes guaranteed access to the best available health care services for our female veterans and not being treated right we must also do more to help our veterans find jobs every year large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas and across the border to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our veterans veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect they fought hard to protect us they are going to come first in a trump administration they will be they will be a part of america first it will be america first from now on america first yeah thank you thank you veteran's health care must also include the best mental health care a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day especially our older veterans this is a national tragedy that's not talked about the evidence shows that our veterans are in the system receiving care they are much less likely to take their own lives than veterans outside of this horrible horrible and very unfair system that is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the va while ensuring that veterans can access private mental health care as well have to do it have to do we have no choice america must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large this is for everyone this includes expanding the number of facilities integrating primary care and mental health care professionals reforming confinement rules very important and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones to the care and of the care they need especially in the many emergencies that were having all over the country and doing nothing whatsoever about it one of the most important reforms we can make his accountability right now when va employees fail our veterans you can't discipline them that's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform have to do it we like it we don't like it we have to do it it's time in fact employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions in 2014 the va awarded a 142 million dollars in bonuses to employees including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the denver va hospital that was more than 1 billion dollars over budget to other via executives signed abuse and they really abused it was terrible abuse their authority to obtain four hundred thousand dollars in relocation benefits currently a scandal and we're doing nothing about it doesn't have to be this way as veterans affair chairman jeff miller just said and will say all the time the va is not sacred the veteran is sacred the veteran is yeah thank you here is my 10-step plan to ensure quality timely care for every single veteran in america one i will appoint a secretary of veterans affair who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the va and this will be a person of great competence this will not be a political hack the secretary is sold mandate will be to serve our veterans are bureaucrats not politicians but veterans amazingly president obama's va secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at disneyland so what's wrong with that right - i'm going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail are veterans or breach the public trust 3 i'm going to ask congress to pass legislation that ensures the secretary of veterans affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health safety or well-being appoint a commission to investigate all of the wrongdoing at the va and then present those findings to congress as the basis for bold legislative reform all right i'm going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the va have their jobs protected and are put in line for serious promotions if they continue to do great work i will create a private white house hotline that is really and so importantly going to be answered by a real person actually a person not a computer that picks up yeah and i don't take place 24 hours a day to ensure that no valid complaint about the va and it's wrongdoing falls through the cracks i will instruct my staff that have a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me and i will pick up the phone and fix it myself if i have to believe thank you seven we are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money wasting money the bonuses the money that's being paid out and start giving bonuses to people for improving service saving lives and cutting waste if an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates really better outcomes for our veterans that a small responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to the taxpayers and it will be a lot we are going to reform our visa programs to ensure american veterans are in the front not the back of a line 9 we're going to increase the number of mental health care facilities and professionals and increase the outreach to veterans outside of the system of which there are many 10 we are going to ensure every veteran in america has the choice to seek care at the veterans administration or to seek private medical care paid for by our government never again will we allow a veteran to suffer a die waiting for care they so richly deserve these are our great people we need to clean out the corruption in government and hillary clinton will never be able to do it she's incompetent and has proven time and time again that she doesn't have what it takes doesn't have it yeah crooked hillary clinton sadly sadly crooked hillary clinton is the secretary of the status quo and wherever hillary clinton goes corruption and scandal follow just look at her life our country needs change and she will never give us change never ever ever the fact is she helped create a rigged system you saw that last week hillary clinton's america is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment so true and she couldn't care less despite what she says she couldn't care less the rake system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of us everybody in this room everybody in this country at risk hillary clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and the bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials what she did was so wrong what other people did far less and they're paying a tremendous price right now in other words she was willing to risk our farm enemies reading your emails as long as the voting american public could not her conduct was willful intentional and unlawful and to repeated false statements about her condom prove that she was fully aware of her guilt she knew it she's probably the most surprised person that she was able to get away with it ok this was not just extreme carelessness with classified material which is still totally disqualified this is calculated deliberate premeditated misconduct followed by a cover-up that included full statements and lies to congress the media and the american people in fact when the fbi interviewed her for only three hours during the fourth of july weekend her interview was not recorded and she was amazingly not even under oath you didn't know that she carried out her dangers email scheme at the same time as her bad judgment and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing isis all across the world afterwards as a further demonstration of guilt hillary clinton erased more than 30,000 emails as part of a cover-up tell reason part of a cover hard to believe what's going on with our country the fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment to me it is the greatest accomplice when thinking about our email destruction let's not forget many foreign and corporate entities and other special interests with business before hillary clinton state department were making massive financial contributions folks these contributions were made to both the clinton foundation and to the clintons directly if elected hillary clinton would become the first president of the united states who wouldn't be able to pass a background check she would not be able just look at what the fbi director said about her misconduct is a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country clearly hillary clinton thinks she's above the law come november the american people will show her that she is thank you yeah the decades of decay division in decline will come to an end rapidly the years of america's greatness will return we are going to become for the first time in a long time one united country we're going to make america great again and safe again for all americans we will dream big and bold and daring things once more once more we're going to go big we're going to go great you can be so proud of your country let me conclude by paying tribute to every single american here who has served this country and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice yeah thank you thank you our debt to them is eternal and everlasting we are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have thought for us we will be a safe strong and proud country again ladies and gentlemen thank you very much thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the center for national interests for honoring me with this invitation. it truly is a great honor. i'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country. one that replaces randomness with purpose. ideology with strategy. and chaos with peace. it's time to shake the rust off america's foreign policy. it's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold. something we have to do. the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. my foreign policy always puts the interests of the american people and american security above all else. has to be first. has to be. that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make. [ applause ] thank you. america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. but to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. we have a lot to be proud of in the 1940s, we saved the world. the greatest generation beat back the nazis and japanese impeer impeerialists. then we saved the world again. this time, from totalitarianism and communism, the cold war, it lasted for decades but guess what, we won and we won big. democrats and republicans working together got mr. gorbichav to heed the words when he said tear down this wall. history will not forget what he did, very special, special man and president. unfortunately, after the cold war, our foreign policy veered badly off course. we failed to develop a new vision for a new time. in fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. they just kept coming and coming. we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya to president obama's line in the sand in syria. each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper. very bad. it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy. we tore up what institutions they had and then we're surprised at what we unleashed. civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of americans and just killed lives, lives wasted. horribly wasted. many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. the vacuum was created that isis would fill. iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment. they have benefitted so much, so sadly for us. our foreign policy is a complete disaster. no vision, no purpose. no direction. today, i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. first, our resources are totally overextended. president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. we're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen, and regain our financial independence and strength. i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem. i am the only one, believe me, i know them all, i am the only one that knows how to fix it. secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share. and i've been talking about this recently a lot. our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs. have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. but many of them are simply not doing so. they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. in nato, for instance, only four of 28 other member countries besides america are spending the minimum required 2% of gdp on defense. we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia. the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense. and if not, the u.s. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. we have no choice. the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully. third, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us. we've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies. something that we've never seen before in the history of our country. he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran and then we watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry. iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. and under a trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon. all of this, without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran's treatment of our 10 captured sailors so zvividly, i remember the day. in negotiation, you must be willing to walk. the iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. when the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win. you can't win. at the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. you've made that agreement. you have to stand by it. and the world will be a better place. president obama gutted our missile defense program. then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic. he supported the oust of a friendly regime in egypt that had a long standing peace treaty with israel and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place. israel, our great friend, and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity, just a few days ago, vice president biden, again, criticized israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region. president obama has not been a friend to israel. he's treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. iran has indeed become a great, great power in just a very short period of time because of what we've done. all of the expense and all at the expense of israel, our allies in the region, and very importantly, the united states itself. we picked fights with our oldest friends and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help. remember that. not good. fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. in fact, they're just as confused as our allies. but an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously anymore. truth is, they don't respect us. when president obama landed in cuba on air force one, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him. perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one. and then amazingly, the same thing happened in saudi arabia. it's called no respect. absolutely no respect. do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen denmark to get the olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the united states came in fourth, fourth place. the president of the united states making this trip, unprecedented, comes in fourth place. he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. we were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times. the list of humiliations go on and on and on. president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth, refusing trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to reign in north korea. we have the leverage. we have the power. over china, economic power and people don't understand that. with that economic power, we can re rein in and get them to do what they have to do with north korea which is totally out of control. he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the united states and its companies. we've let our rivals and away with anything. they do. if president obama's goal was to weaken america, he could not have done a better job. finally, america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. since the end of the cold war, and the break-up of the soviet union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy. one day, we're bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to force their democracy for civilians. the next day, we're watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. lives lost. massive moneys lost. the world is a different place. we're a humanitarian nation. but the legacy of the obama/clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion, and dis disarray. a mess. we've made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before. we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. [ applause ] we have done nothing to help the christians. nothing. and we should always be ashamed for that. for that lack of action. our actions in iraq, libya, and syria have helped unleash isis. and we're at war against radical islam but president obama won't even name the enemy and unless you name the enemy, you will hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. after secretary clinton's failed intervention in libya, islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans. then instead of taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep. incredible. clinton blames it all on a video. an excuse that was a total lie. proven to be, absolutely a total lie. our ambassador was murdered, and our secretary of state misled the nation. and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3:00 in the morning. and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil and you know what? we don't blockade. we don't bomb. we don't do anything about it. it's almost as if our country doesn't even know what's happening, which could be a fact and could be true. this will all change when i become president. to our friends and allies, i say, america is going to be strong again. america is going to be reliable again. it's going to be a great and reliable ally again. it's going to be a friend again. we're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies. we're getting out of the nation-building business and instead, focusing on creating stability in the world. our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge. we need a new rational american foreign policy. informed by the best minds and supported by both parties and it will be by both parties. democrats, republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies. this is how we won the cold war and it's how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if i become president. first, we need a long-term plan to halt this spread and reach of radical islam. containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states of the united states and indeed, the world. events may require the use of military force, but it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the cold war. in this, we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world. all of which are at risk for radical islamic violence, attacks, and everything else. it is a dangerous world. more dangerous now than it has ever been. we should work -- [ applause ] thank you. we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam. but this has to be a two-way street. they must also be good to us. remember that. they have to be good to us. no longer one way. it's now two-way. and remember, us and all we're doing, they have to appreciate what we've done to them. we're going to help, but they have to appreciate what we've done for them. the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland. there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. for every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. we have no ideas where these people are coming from. there's no documentation. there's no paperwork. there's nothing. we have to be smart. we have to be vigilant. a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or, frankly, much worse. all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th. one of the great catastrophes, and my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country, worse than pearl harbor, because you take a look at what's happened and citizens were attacked as opposed to the military being attacked. one of the true great catastrophes. and then there's isis. i have a simple message for them. their days are numbered. i won't tell them where and i won't tell them how. we must -- [ applause ] we must, as a nation, be more unpredictable. we are totally predictable. we tell everything. we're sending troops, we tell them. we're sending something else, we have a news conferece. we have to be unpredictable. and we have to be unpredictable starting now. but they're going to be gone. isis will be gone if i am elected president and they'll be gone quickly. they will be gone very, very [ applause ] secondly, we have to rebuild our military, and our economy. the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded the military capability, but look at what's happened to us. our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal and it has to happen immediately. our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. the navy has shrunk from 500. and the air force about one-third smaller than 1991. pilots flying b-52s in combat missions today. these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room. and what are we doing about this? president obama has proposed a  nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011. our military is depleted, and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming. we will spend what we need to rebuild our military. it is the cheapest single investment we can make. we will develop, build, and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. our military dominance must be unquestioned and i mean, unquestioned by anybody and everybody. but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. in this time of mounting debt, right now, we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. but i do. no one dollar can be wasted. not one single dollar can we waste. we're also going to have to change our trade, immigration, and economic policies to make our economy strong again. and to put americans first again. this will ensure that our own workers, right here in america, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. so, so important. we need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority and no one comes close gives us an edge. this includes 3-d printing, artificial intelligence, and cyberwarfare. a great country also takes care of its warriors. our commitment to them is absolute and i mean absolute. a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when and where they serve and the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. our veterans -- [ applause ] our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. these are our great people. and we must treat them fairly. we must even treat them really, really well, and that will happen under the trump administration. finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests. businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. look at what happened in the 1990s. our embassies in kenya and tan se tanzania, a horrible period of time where we were attacked and 17 brave sailors killed on the uss call and what we do? it seemed we put more effort to adding china into the world trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the united states, frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda. we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn't do it. and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon. again, the worst attack on our country in its history. our foreign policy goals must be based on america's core national security interests. and the following will be my priorities. in the middle east, our goal must be and i mean must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability. not radical change. we need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. and believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy. we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are. and not help them. and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends. [ applause ] we desire to live peacefully. and in friendship with russia and china, we have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes. but we are not bound to be adversaries. we should seek common ground based on shared interests. russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism. i believe an easing of tension russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally, would end soon. good for both countries. some say the russians won't be reasonable. i intend to find out. if we can't make a deal under my administration, a deal that's great, not good, great for america, but also good for russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. it's as simple as that. we're going to find out. fixing our relations with china is another important step in really creating for a more prosperous time. china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect. we have a massive trade deficit with china. a deficit that we have to find a way quickly and i mean quickly to balance. a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china, better than we have right now. look at what china's doing in the south china sea. they're not supposed to be doing it. no respect for this country or this president. we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. if need be, that's what's going to have to happen. after i am elected president, i will call for a summit with our nato allies. and a separate summit with our asian allies. in these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. for instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade nato's outdated mission and structure grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges. including migration and islamic terrorism. i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. but if america fights, it must only fight to win. [ applause ] i will never send our finest into battle unless necessary, and i mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital "v." our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. with president obama and secretary clinton, we've had the exact opposite. a reckless, ruttedderless and aimless foreign policy that's blazed a path of destruction in its wake. after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worse shape in the middle east than ever, ever, ever before. i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obama/clinton. it has been a complete and total disaster. i will also be prepared to deploy america's economic resources. leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. in other words, if they do not treat us fairly. our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand, i will enforce that line in the sand. however, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. a super power understands that caution and restraint are truly signs of strength. although not in government service, i was totally against the war in iraq. very proudly. saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east. sadly, i was correct. and the biggest beneficiary has been iran. who has systemically gained access to rich oil reserves. something it has wanted to do for decades. and now to top it off, we have isis. my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. that's why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. we have to look to new people. [ applause ] we have to look to new people because many of the old people, frankly, don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in "the new york times" or watched on television. finally, i will work with our allies to reinvigorate values and institutions instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants. we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. these are my goals as president. i will seek a foreign policy that all americans, whatever their party, can support, so important. and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. the world must know that we do not go aboard in search of enemies. we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies. that's what we want. we want them to be our allies. we want the world -- we want to be bring peace to the world. too much destruction out there. too many destructive weapons. the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world. to achieve these goals, americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership, again, many americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. [ applause ] americans must know that we are putting the american people first again. on trade. so true. on trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, the jobs, incomes, and security of the american worker will always be [ applause ] no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. both our friend and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. this state remains the state for happiness and harmony. i'm skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never en enter. and under my administration, we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs. nafta, as an example, has been a total disaster for the united states and has emptied our states, literally, emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs and i've just gotten to see it. i've toured pennsylvania. i've toured new york. i have toured so many of the states. they have been cleaned out. their manufacturing is gone. never again. and i have to say this strongly, never again, only the reverse will happen. we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later. they fire the people. they take advantage of the united states. there will be consequences for those companies. never again. under a trump administration, no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country. [ applause ] i will view, as president, the world through the clear lens of american interests. i will be america's greatest defender and most loyal champion. we will not apologize for becoming successful again. but we'll instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are. the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest. america will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. we will always help save lives and indeed, humanity itself. but to play that role, we must make america strong again. [ applause ] and always, always, always, look at it from every angle and we must make america respected again. we must make america truly wealthy again and we must, we have to and we will make america great again. and if we do that, and if we do that, perhaps this century can thank you. thank you very much. friends, delegates and fellow americans, i humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of usa, usa, usa. who would have believed that when we started this journey on june 16th last year, we and i say we because we are a team, would have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the republican party and that the republican party would get 60% more votes than it received eight years ago. who would have believed this? who would have believed this? the democrats on the other hand received 20% fewer votes than they got four years ago. not so good. together we will lead our party back to the white house and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace. we will be a country of generosity and warmth, but we will also be a country of law our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. the attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life. any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. many have witnessed this violence personally. some have even been its victims. i have a message for all of you that crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon and i mean very soon come beginning on january 20th of 2017, safety will be restored. the most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. it is finally time for a straight forward assessment of the state of our nation. i will present the facts plainly and honestly. we cannot afford to be so so if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies and the media myths, the democrats are holding their convention next week. go there. but here at our convention, there will be no lies. we will honor the american people with the truth and these are the facts:  decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. homicides last year increased by 17% in america's 50 largest cities. that's the largest increase in 25 years. in our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50%. they're up nearly 60% in nearby baltimore. in the president's hometown of chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. and almost 4,000 have been killed in the chicago area since he took office. the number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. the number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. they are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or one such border crosser was released and made his way to nebraska. there he ended the life of an innocent young girl named sara rute. she was 21 years old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average, number one in her class. her killer was then released a second time and he is now a fugitive from the law. i've met sara's beautiful family, but to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more american life that wasn't worth protecting. no more. one more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. what about our economy? again, i will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper. nearly 4 in 10 african-american children are living in poverty while 58% of african-american youth are now not employed. 2 million more latinos are in poverty today than when president obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. that's 16 years ago. our trade deficit in goods reached nearly -- think of this, think of this. our trade deficit is $800 billion -- think of that. $800 billion last year alone. the budget is no better. president obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion and growing. and yet what do we have to show for it? our roads and bridges are falling apart. our airports are third world condition, and 43 million americans are on food stamps. now, let us consider the state of affairs abroad. not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another, one after another! we all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their iranian captors at gun point. this was just prior to the signing of the iran deal, which gave back to iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing. it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. another humiliation came when president obama drew a red line in syria and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. in libya our consulate, the symbol of america prestige around the globe was brought down in flames. america is far less safe and the world is far less stable than when obama made the decision to put hillary clinton in charge of let's defeat her in november, i am certain that it was a decision that president obama truly regrets. her bad instincts and her bad judgment, something pointed out by bernie sanders, are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. let's review the record. in 2009 pre-hillary, isis was not even on the map, libya was stable, egypt was peaceful, iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence, iran was being choked by sanctions, syria was somewhat under control. after four years of hillary clinton, what do we have? isis has spread across the region and the entire world. libya is in ruins and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. egypt was turned over to the radical muslim brotherhood forcing the military to retake control. iraq is in chaos. iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. syria is in engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the west. after 15 years of wars in the middle east, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. this is the legacy of hillary clinton. death, destruction, terrorism but hillary clinton's legacy does not have to be america's legacy. the problems we face now, poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. a change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. tonight i will share with you my plan for action for america, the most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will americanism, not globalism, will be our credo as long as we are led by politicians who will not put america first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat america with respect, the respect that we deserve. the american people will come first ones again. -- once again. my plan will begin with safety at home, which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders and protection from terrorism. there can be no prosperity on the economy, i will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild america. a number of these reforms that i will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. that's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. believe me, it's for their benefit. big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. they are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. she is their puppet and they pull the strings. that is why hillary clinton's message is that things will never change, never ever. my message is that things have to change and they have to every day i wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. i have visited the laid off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. these are the forgotten men and women of our country, and they are forgotten but they're not going to be forgotten long. these are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. i am your voice. i have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. i have no patience for how great are our police and how thank you. i have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, of which there is so much. no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. when innocent people suffer because our political system lacks the will or the courage or the basic decency to enforce our laws or still worse has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash, i am not able to look the other way and i won't look the other way. and when a secretary of state illegally stores her e-mails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence, i know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our when the fbi director says that the secretary of state was extremely careless and negligent in handling our classified secrets, i also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. they were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes. in fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it, especially when others who have done far less have paid so dearly. when that same secretary of state rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, i know the time for action has come. i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. nobody knows the system better than me. which is why i alone can fix it. i have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against bernie sanders. he never had a chance. never had a chance. but his supporters will join our movement because we will fix his biggest single issue, trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country. millions of democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for each and every american. in this cause, i am proud to have at my side the next vice president of the united states, and a great guy. we will bring the same economic success to america that mike brought to indiana, which is amazing. he's a man of character and accomplishment. he is the man for the job. the first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our communities. america was shocked to its core when our police officers in dallas were so brutally executed. immediately after dallas, we've seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in georgia, missouri, wisconsin, kansas, michigan and tennessee. on sunday more police were gunned down in baton rouge, louisiana. three were killed and three were very, very badly injured. an attack on law enforcement is i have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police. when i take the oath of office next year, i will restore law and order to our country. believe me, believe me. i will work with and appoint the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. in this race for the white house, i am the law and order the irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made america a more dangerous environment than frankly i have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen. this administration has failed america's inner cities. remember, it has failed america's inner cities. it's failed them on education, it's failed them on jobs, it's failed them on crime, it's failed them in every way and on every single level. when i am president, i will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equally. every action i take i will ask myself, does this make better for young americans in baltimore, in chicago, in detroit, in ferguson who have really in every way, folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in america. any other child. to make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country. we are going to defeat the barbarians of isis, and we're once again, france is the victim of brutal islamic terrorism. men, women and children viciously mowed down, lives ruined, families ripped apart, a nation in mourning. the damage and devastation that can be inflicted by islamic radicals has been proven over and over. at the world trade center, at an office party in san bernardino, at the boston marathon, at a military recruiting center in chattanooga, tennessee, and many, many other locations. only weeks ago in orlando, florida 49 wonderful americans were savagely murdered by an islamic terrorist. this time the terrorist targeted lgbtq community. no good and we're going to stop as your president, i will do everything in my power to protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology, and i have to say as a republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what i just said. to protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. we must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. the best. we must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that hillary clinton pushed in iraq, in libya, in egypt and in syria. instead we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying isis and stamping out islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly, we're going to win, we're going to win this includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the recently i have said that nato was obsolete because it did not properly cover terror. and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. as usual, the united states has been picking up the cost. shortly thereafter, it was announced that nato will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. a true step in the right direction. lastly and very importantly we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. we don't want them in our my opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in syrian -- think of this, think of this. this is not believable but this is what's happening. a 550% increase in syrian refugees on top of the existing massive refugee flows coming in to our country already under the leadership of president obama. she proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. i only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never, ever will be. decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for african-american and latino workers. we are going to have an immigration system that works but one that works for the american people. on monday we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants. mary ann mendoza, subbine durden and my friend jameel shaw. they're just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close i have to tell you, than the time i have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve. these families have no special interests to represent them. there are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. my opponent will never meet with them or share in their pain, believe me. instead my opponent wants sanctuary cities. but where was the sanctuary for kate steinly? where was the sanctuary for the children of marian and saabine and jamily? where was the sanctuary for all of the -- oh, it's so sad to even be talking about it because we can solve this problem so quickly. where was the sanctuary for all of the other americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so, so horribly? these wounded american families have been alone, but they are tonight this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate. we are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into our i have been honored to receive the endorsement of america's border patrol agents. and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. lawful. by ending catch and release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. illegal border crossings will go down. we will stop it. it won't be happening very much anymore, believe me. peace will be restored by enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas. our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve. tonight i want every american whose demands for immigration security have been denied and every politician who has denied them to listen very, very closely to the words i am about to say. on january 20th of 2017, the day i take the oath of office, americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the united states are enforced. we are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone, but my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling usa, usa, usa. my plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of hillary clinton. americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration, which is what we have now. communities want relief, yet hillary clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration and mass lawlessness. her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. i have a different vision for our workers. it begins with a new fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. it's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment i take the oath of office. i have made billions of dollars in business making deals. now i'm going to make our country rich again. using the greatest businesspeople in the world, which our country has, i am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. america has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs sense 1997 following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by bill and hillary clinton. remember, it was bill clinton who signed nafta, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country or frankly any other country. never, ever again. i am going to bring back our jobs to ohio and pennsylvania and new york and michigan and all of america, and i am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way without consequence. not going to happen anymore. my opponent on the other hand has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. she supported nafta and she supported china's entrance into the world trade organization, another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters. she supported the job killing trade deal with south korea. she supported the transpacific partnership, which will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make america subject to the rulings of foreign governments and it's not going to happen. i pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and our independence. we will never ever sign bad trade deals. america first. again, america first. instead i will make individual deals with individual countries. no longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands. we are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats. this includes stopping china's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping and their devastating currency manipulation. they are the greatest that ever came about, they are the greatest currency manipulateors ever! our horrible trade agreements with china and many others will be totally renegotiated. that includes renegotiating nafta to get a much better deal for america and will walk away if we don't get that kind of a deal! our country is going to start building and making things again. next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. while hillary clinton plans a massive, and i mean massive tax increase, i have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, democrat or republican. middle income americans and businesses will experience profound relief and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. i mean everyone. america is one of the highest taxed nations in the world. reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. believe me, it will happen and it will happen fast. then we're going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job killers of them all. excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly. we are going to lift the restrictions on the production of american energy. this will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades. my opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steel workers of our country out of work and out of business. that will never happen with donald j. trump as president. our steel workers and our miners are going back to work again. with these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. this new wealth will improve the quality of life for all americans. we will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. this in turn will create millions of more jobs. we will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. my opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve american children, and that's what she's doing and that's what she's done. we will repeal and replace disastrous obama care! you will be able to choose your own doctor again. and we will fix tsa at the airports, which is a total thank you. thank you. we're going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. tremendous problem. we will completely rebuild our depleted military. and the countries that we are protecting at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share! we will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. my just released ten-point plan has received tremendous veteran support. we will guarantee those who my opponent dismissed the v.a. scandal. one more sign of how out of touch she really is. we are going to department head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending, a project that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. the politicians have talked about this for year, but i'm we are going to appoint justices of the united states supreme court who will uphold our laws the replacement of our beloved justice scalia will be a person of similar views, principles and judicial philosophies, very important. this will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. my opponent wants to essentially abolish the second amendment. i, on the other hand, received early and strong endorsement of the national rifle association. and will protect the right of all americans to keep their families safe. at this moment i would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because i'll tell you what, the support that they've given me, and i'm not sure i totally deserve it, has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. true. so true. they have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. an amendment pushed by lyndon johnson many years ago threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. their voice has been taken away. i am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all we can accomplish these great things and so much more. all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. start believing. it is time to show the whole world that america is become, bigger and better and stronger in this journey i'm so lucky to have at my side my wife, melania, and my wonderful children. don, ivanka, eric, tiffany and baron, you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. and, by the way, melania and ivanka, did they do a job. my dad, fred trump, was the smartest and hardest working man i ever knew. i wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight. it's because of him that i learned from my youngest age to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. he was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers and carpenters and electricians and i have a lot of that in me also. i love those people. then there's my mother, mary. she was strong but also warm and fair minded. she was a truly great mother. she was also one of the most honest and charitable people that i have ever known, and a great, great judge of character. she could pick 'em out from anywhere. to my sisters, marian and elizabeth, my brother, rob robe and my late brother, fred, i will always give you my love. you are most special to me. i have had a truly great life in business, but now my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country, to go to work for you. it's time to deliver a victory for the american people. we don't win anymore, but we are but to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. america is a nation of believers, dreamers and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics. remember, all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want are the same people that wouldn't stand -- i mean, they said trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight, not a chance. the same people. oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? don't we love defeating those people. love it, love it, love it. no longer can we rely on those same people, in the media and politics, who will say anything to keep our rigged system in place. instead, we must choose to believe in america. history is watching us now. we don't have much time. but history is watching. it's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion and if we will show the whole world that america is still free and independent and strong. i am asking for your support tonight so that i can be your champion in the white house, and i will be your champion. my opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. it reads "i'm with her." i choose to recite a different pledge. my pledge reads, "i'm with you, i am your voice. so to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, i say these words to you tonight. i am with you, i will fight for to all americans tonight in all of our cities and in all of our towns, i make this promise -- we will make america strong again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again. and we will make america great again. god bless you and good night! i love you! president of the united states thank you room thank you very much today i'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this upcoming and very important election people have asked me why i'm running for president i built an amazing business that i love and i get to work side-by-side with my children every single day we come to work together and turn visions into reality we think big and then we make it happen we absolutely make it happen i love what i do and i am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it so when people ask me why i am running i very quickly answered i'm running to give back to this country which has been so very good to me yeah when i see the crumbling roads and bridges or the dilapidated airports or the factories moving overseas to mexico or to other countries for that manner i know these problems can all be fixed but not by hillary clinton only by me the fact is we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before i see the possibilities of what our country could be but we can solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created the problems themselves will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place the insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves and power and in the money that's why we're asking bernie sanders voters to join our movement so together we can fix the system for all americans so important this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals and they are disastrous they're destroying our country because it's not just the political system that's rigged it's the whole economy it's rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down it's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country fire our workers and sell their products back into the united states with absolutely no consequences for them it's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools it's rigged against you the american people hillary clinton and as you know she most people know she's a world-class liar just look at her pathetic email server statements for her phony landing or her phony landing in bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers a total and search look this was this was one of the buttes a total and self-serving lie brian williams career was destroyed for saying less just remember that yesterday she even tried to attack me and my many businesses but here and this is the way it is is the bottom line i started off in brooklyn new york not so long ago with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over ten billion dollars and that's the kind of thinking we need in our leadership of our country i've always had a talent for building businesses and importantly for creating jobs that's a talent our country desperately needs i'm running for president to end the unfairness and to put you the american worker first it's about time we're going to put america's first and we're going to make america great again this election will decide whether we are ruled by the people or by the politicians here is my promise to the american voter if i'm elected president i will end the special interest monopoly in washington dc very important the other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests and i will tell you she's made plenty of money for them and she's been taking plenty of money out for herself hillary clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft she ran the state department like our own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really many many others in exchange for cash pure and simple folks then when she left she made 21.6 million dollars giving speeches to wall street banks and other special interests and in less than two years secret speeches that she does not want to reveal under any circumstances to the public i wonder why together she and bill made 153 million dollars giving speeches to lobbyists ceos and foreign governments in the years since 2001 they totally owner and that will never ever change including if she ever became president god help us the choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering really the last scrap of independence to the total and complete control of people like the clintons those are the stakes hillary clinton wants to be president but she doesn't have the temperament or as bernie sanders said very strongly the judgment to be president she does not have the judgment she believes she believes she's entitled to the office her campaign slogan is i'm with her you know what my responses to that i'm with you thank you very much she thinks it's all about her i know it's all about you i know it's all about making america great again for all americans all americans our country lost his way when it stopped putting the american people really first we have to go back to putting american people first we got here because we switched from the policy of americanism focusing on what's good for america's middle class to a policy of globalism focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the american worker and the american economy itself we reward companies for offshoring and we punish companies for doing business in america and keeping our workers employed they get punished this is not a rising tide that lifts all boats this is a wave of globalism that wipes out our middle class and our jobs along with it we need reform and we have to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together in america can become rich again we have to make the america rich again yeah and that's what i mean by america first our country will be better off when we start making our own products again bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to the shores i mean we have to bring our manufacturers back to the united states desperately needed desperately we need those jobs and we needed even from our psyche one of the really great things and one of the first major bills that george washington signed was amazing when i saw this for the first time the encouragement and protection of manufacturing in america our first republican president abraham lincoln warned us by saying the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government will produce want and ruin among our people in other words we have to protect our country i have decided and visited cities and towns across america all across america and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of bill and hillary clinton and its total devastation all over new york all over pennsylvania all of in new england all over the country hillary clinton supported bill clinton's disasters and totally disasters and after just like she supported china's entrance into the world trade organization we've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two hillary backed agreements were signed among the worst we've ever done among the most destructive agreements we've ever signed our trade deficit with china sword forty percent during hillary clinton's time as secretary of state a disgraceful performance for which he should not be congratulated but rather scorned then she left china yeah then she left china and what happened is billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property and china has taken it and it's a crime which is continuously going on and it's going on right now they are stealing billions and billions of dollars of our intellectual property hillary clinton gave john a millions of jobs in our best jobs and effectively let china completely rebuild itself in return hillary clinton got rich the book clinton cash by peter schweitzer documents how bill and hillary used the state department to enrich their family and america's and add america's expense here is a quote from the book at the center of us policy toward china was hillary clinton at this critical time for us china relations bill clinton gave her a number of speeches that were underwritten by the chinese government and its supporters these funds were paid to the clintons bank account directly while hilary was negotiating with china on behalf of the united states tel me folks does that work she sold out our workers and our country for beijing hillary clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the trans-pacific partnership which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission now because i have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal she's pretending that she's against it she's given and deleted as you know and most people have heard about this have we haven't heard about her deleting anything no i don't think so she deleted the entire record from her book and deletion is something she really does know something about because she's deleted at least 30,000 emails which by the way should be able to beat rap should be able to be found because the government i will say i've always heard you can never really delete an email so it should be able to be fun if they really want to find them but i don't think they want to find them this is the latest clinton cover up and it doesn't change anything if she is elected president she will adopt the trans-pacific partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good she'll do this and just as she has betrayed the american worker and traded every single stage of a career and it will be even worse than the clintons nafta deal and i never thought it could get worse than that we will lose jobs we will lose employment we will lose taxes we will lose everything we will lose our country i want trade deals but they have to be great for the united states and for our workers yeah we don't make great deals anymore but we will once i become president i promise you it's not just our economy that's been corrupted but our foreign policy to the hillary clinton foreign policy is cost american thousands of lives and trillions and trillions of dollars and unleashed isis across the world no secretary of state has been more wrong more often and in more places than hillary clinton her decision spread death destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched among the victims of our late ambassador chris stevens i mean she what she did with him was absolutely horrible he was left helpless to die as hillary clinton soundly slept in her bed that's right when the phone rang as per the commercial at three o'clock in the morning hillary clinton was sleeping ambassador stevens and his staff in libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security they were desperate they needed help hillary clinton state department refused them all she started the war that put them in libya denied him to security he asked for then left him there to die to cover tracks hillary lied about the video being the cause of death the famous video all a lie another hillary lie here's what one of the victim's mother had to say i want the whole world to knowing she lied to my face and you know this person cannot be president she cannot be present yeah in 2009 before hillary clinton was sworn in it was a different world libya was cooperating iraq was seeing a reduction in violence believe it or not syria was under control iran was being choked by sanctions egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honors is peace treaty with israel something very nice because by the way israel has been totally mistreated by the united states isis wasn't even on the map fast forward to 2013 in just four years secretary clinton managed almost single-handedly destabilize the entire middle east her invasion of libya handed the country over to isis the barbarians thanks to hilary clinton iran is now the dominant islamic power in the middle east and on the road to nuclear weapons hillary clinton support for violent regime change in syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen while giving isis a launching pad for terrorism against the west she helped force out a friendly regime in egypt and replace it with the radical muslim brotherhood the egyptian military has retaken control but clinton has opened the pandora's box of radical islam then there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure from iraq handling large parts of the country over to isis and the isis killers isis threatens us today because of the decisions hillary clinton has made along with president obama isis also threatens peaceful muslims across the middle east and peaceful muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety in short in short hillary clinton's triumph for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another one by one they're all bad she's virtually done nothing right she's virtually done nothing good it all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in iraq in the first place though i was not in government service i was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and yes even before the war ever started but hillary clinton learned nothing from iraq because when she got into power she couldn't wait to rushes off to war in libya she lacks the temperament and the judgment and the competence to lead our country she should not be president under any circumstance yeah in the words of a secret service agent posted outside the oval office somebody that saw her a lot and nose are probably better than almost anybody she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office from the bottom of my soul i know this to be true her leadership style volcanic impulsive disdainful and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed one bit perhaps the most terrifying thing about hillary clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical islam in fact hillary clinton supports a radical five hundred and fifty percent increase in syrian refugees coming into the united states and that's an increase over president obama is already high number under her plan we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on earth with no way to screen who they are what they are what they believe where they come from already hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the united states the father of the orlando shooter was a taliban supporter from afghanistan one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-woman regimes on earth i only want to admit people who share our values and love our people yeah yeah carrie clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death maybe your motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations hillary failed to disclose while at the state department hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the thank you thank you yeah thank you here's some of really what we learned from the book in addition to what we've already discussed a foreign telecom giant face possible state department sanctions for providing technology to iran and other oppressive regimes so what did this company do for the first time ever they decided to pay bill clinton 750 thousand dollars for a single speech the clintons got their cash the telecom company escaped all sanctions hillary clinton state department approve the transfer of twenty percent of america's uranium holdings to russian well nine investors in the deal funneled 145 million dollars to the clinton foundation 145 million dollars hillary clinton appointed a top donor to a national security bored with cop secret access even though he had no national security credentials although he did make a very large campaign contribution hillary clinton accepted fifty-eight thousand dollars in jewelry from the government of brunei when she was secretary of state plus millions more for her foundation the sultan of brunei has pushed oppressive sharia law including the punishment by death and starting if you happen to be game the government of brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiary of hillary's trans-pacific partnership which he would absolutely approve if given the chance hillary clinton's book and just think of this the book talks about it but hillary took 25 million dollars from saudi arabia and much more from us where being gay is also punishable by death hillary took millions from kuwait qatar oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and the lg bt citizens to cover up her corrupt dealings hillary illegally staged her state department emails on a private server she's under investigation but it seems like nothing's going to happen even though other people who have done similar things but much at a much lower level their lives have been destroyed it's a rigged system folks it's a rigged system her server with easily hacked by foreign governments perhaps even by her financial backers in communist china sure they have it putting all of america and our citizens in danger great danger then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted well we may not know what's in those deleted emails are enemies probably know every single one of them so they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be the president of the united states this fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency we can't hand over our government to someone who's deepest darkest secrets maybe in the hands of our enemies can't do it ok national security is also immigration security and hillary once neither hilary clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the united states she's pledged to grant mass amnesty and in a first 100 days and virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the united states totally open borders and by the way 16,500 border patrol agents have endorsed donald trump first time in the history that they've been doing the first victims of a radical policies will be poor african-american and hispanic workers who need jobs they're also the ones that she will hurt the most by far let me share with you a letter our campaign received from marianne mendoza she lost her amazing son police sergeant brandon mendoza after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of open borders and policies supported by hillary clinton sadly the mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same thing here is an excerpt from mrs. mendoza is letter hillary clinton who already has the blood of so many on her hands is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harm's way an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country hilary is not concerned about you are i she is only concerned about the power of the presidency and the power that it would bring she needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes that she's already committed against our country that's from mrs. mendoza hillary also wants to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to settle middle eastern refugees in the united states on top of the current record level of immigration that we already have for the amount of money hillary clinton would like to spend on refugees we could we build every inner city in america yeah yeah hillary's wall street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed americans totally out of work she can't claim to care about african-american and hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low wage earners to compete against them and win against them because the system is rigged against our people here are a few things a trump administration will do for the americans and for the american people but for our country number one first hundred days i will appoint judges who will uphold the constitution of the united states hillary clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the second amendment can't let that happen i would change immigration rules to give unemployed americans an opportunity to feel good really good paying jobs we don't have good jobs anymore these will be good paying jobs we stand up to countries that cheat on trade of which there are many will cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas and everywhere else but we stand up to countries that cheat on trade of which there are many will cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas and everywhere else but our country the lift restrictions on energy production we will repeal and replace job-killing obamacare it is a we'll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone and we are by the way the highest taxed nation in the world please remember that going to impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the office of the secretary of state there is one common theme in all of these reforms it's going to be america first this is why stakes in november are so great on election day the politicians stand trial before the people the voters are the jury their ballots are the verdict we don't need or want another clinton or obama we just can't take it anymore so bad for our country and our people come november the american people will have a chance to issue a verdict when the politicians that have sacrificed their security the trade their prosperity and sold out their country and i mean totally sold out their country it will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the american people hillary clinton's message is all and tired her message is that things can't change my message is that things have to change and that this is our one chance and may be our only chance to do that change and if we don't do it now folks i don't know that we'll ever ever have another chance we have to have change but real change not obama change ok americans are the people that came the west that dugout the panama canal that send satellites across the solar system that built the great dams and so much more then we we really started thinking small something happened something happened to our mentality we started thinking small we stopped believing in what america could do and became reliant on other countries other people and other institutions we lost our sense of purpose and come to this november we can bring america back bigger and better and stronger than ever before we will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow our military our military which is totally depleted will have the best technology and the finest equipment we will bring it back to the way that it must be factories will come roaring into our country breathing life and hope into our communities inner cities which have been horribly abused by hillary clinton and the democrat party will finally finally finally be rebuilt construction is what i know i say nobody knows it better the real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years but these wages will start going up along with new jobs jobs jobs hillary's massive taxation regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone and that's what's been happening and that's why you're seeing so many people coming to our rallies and so much unbelievable support we're also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement we can never forget the great job they do yeah thank you i'm also going to appoint great supreme court justice is so important one of the most important factors in this election and i have many appts could be as many as five probably will be three could be for one of the really big factors in this election we are going to appoint supreme court justices who will be outstanding outstanding so important our country is going to start working again jobs people are going to start working again parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again including parents in our thank you americans americans the people we love americans america first make our country great again americans are going to start believing in the future of our country we are going to make america rich again we are going to make america safe again we are going to make america great again and great again for everyone everyone thank you very thank you i amazing and ground setting i mean really ground setting we were it was just something very very special we're even getting good marks on television can you believe that hard to believe although change don't want to go to say what but it it has been it has been just an incredible four days i want to thank the people of cleveland and the people of ohio because it's i mean what what they've done you know we read two three weeks ago this is going to be horrible we're going to have riots we're going to have problems and everything was a problem a problem this was probably one of the most peaceful one of the most beautiful one of the most love filled conventions in the history of conventions and when they talk about unity i want to tell you that was unity that was your day right i saw you last night that was unity that was amazing and the party is just come together the party has come together and the few people that aren't there it's okay you know you gotta understand iran is an outsider i didn't want anybody now i have guys like mike pence i mean this isn't supposed to happen see now if i don't win i'm going to blame i right we have to play mine but we want to thank a number of people because in in particular we're going to leave out some because that always happens and it's very sad the set i'm a roast a guy i build buildings and i build things i want to tell you that was the most beautiful set i think i've ever seen not only for conventions but for anything and the folks that worked on that especially the carpenters the electrician's you know we forget about we forget about this stuff those sheet rockers were up there they did a heck of a job i see you gotta wrap that sheetrock and he said yes mr. drop we just cut it i said i know what you do but you don't see it very much we have our chairman from new york i see right over there my man my leader right we're gonna win new york we're gonna try and win new york you know we were in new york it's over right it's over thank you chairman i really appreciate it so a few of the people harold hamm is here where's harold he's around here so look at harold here oh boy you talk about money ie you know barry switzer the great football coach won a super bowl one national championship and i guess he's harold's best friend or one of them so he came up to my office and he's sitting there is you know mr. trump errol is one of the great energy tycoons but more importantly from our standpoint one of the people that really understand energy better than anybody else you know we hired these consultants they don't know what they're doing they were any good they'd be worth ten billion dollars okay but harold is one of the the really knowledgeable people and energy and barry switzer it is a tough cookie and a good guy but a tough cookie he said you know mr. trump that harold hamm he's my friend but these other companies they go out and they spend millions of dollars looking for oil that guy takes his straw puts it the ground and oil pours out of that's the kind of a guy we want telling us about energy right apparel and you made a great speech the other night great to have we want the real players right we don't want the consultants we don't want the guys that he hires we want him so harold grated you here i didn't know you'd be here i appreciate it and your speech was terrific by the way we also have and i think very important jeff sessions who may or may not be here still but i want to tell you he was the first one mikey was right at the beginning and he's so highly respected and honestly ted cruz has so much respect for jeff sessions and everybody knew that jeff sessions was going to be with that cruise during the campaign and you have said you know i've never seen anything like what's happening you've got a movement going on and he was really the first big big player us senator highly respected by everybody one of the really smart people and low key i like that every once in a while you know that low key genes well done ally i don't know about do it that way why don't you try doing it this way i say that's genius every once in a while we have people like that right but jeff sessions was there right at the beginning and it was a huge upset because when jeff came on everybody thought he was going to just routinely be with ted and frankly he's never endorsed anybody before you know he's not an endorser this is he's called a tough endorsement and he went out any endorsement that was a fantastic thing he's been a great help ever since so you have sessions i appreciate it jeff larson's around here someplace was you have larson he's around here someplace what a job jeff did rights of course with by superstar i think he's probably in a plane flying to our next meeting this guy works so hard and i said yesterday in front of a small group because we're raising money like it's crazy what's going on and you know the nice thing first of all i put in over 60 million dollars last month i think i put in 3.8 million but we're raising money also for the republican party which is very important and and the beautiful thing i can guarantee these figures but i heard yesterday alone was like three and a half billion dollars from small donors the average donation was just over fifty dollars and we're raising a tremendous amount of money from the small donors to me that's more important in a sense i mean harold can write his checks but harold's only one vote right these other people give you fifty bucks but they vote by the millions that's what we want the hell with aero drive but but we have you know just tremendous numbers of people coming in and we're really building up a war chest that's going to be great and i'm continuing to fund my campaign large portions of it and fact i thought i gave two million last month and they said no you actually gave 3.8 i said ah it's always good when you don't even know what you gave and it doesn't matter you know it's nice when they say you gave 3.8 and set it to and i don't even get angry at everybody ready but i'm over 60 million dollars because i said i was going to fund the primers and i didn't know this was going to happen so i guess we just keep going along right but i'll tell you it's an honor it's an honor and i oh that i've said this a lot of the television people have come up to me and a lot of the actually one very highly respected writer called up and i've told the story few times but i said he said what you've done is incredible and this was actually in september they called it the summer of trump and he said what you've done is incredible i said nothing is incredible unless i win and i wasn't talking about the primaries he said no no no what you've done is incredible it's been the summer of trump it's down in the history books has never been anything like it bill o'reilly said the greatest single political phenomenon has ever seen in his life a couple of weeks ago did you see that and britt hume said it and i'm not so sure britt hume likes me but he said so but i like him so what happened is they said that i said oh no you don't understand i don't care i don't do anything unless they win and i'm not talking about the primaries i mean the whole thing is otherwise what have we done what are we done then i got a call from somebody else a month ago saying the same thing but now it was the summer of trump it was the order of trump it was the christmas of trump it was everything and its really of you because it's a movement what we have going as a movement i was just under cover of time again this week time magazine's like yeah okay you know i think i was on the cover of time magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months so you tell me which is more important real estate or politics okay that's that's the way is that true harrell so i have 64 politics and i have to for real estate or whatever they put me on for but it's been it's been amazing but i said look it really to me madness they said no no believe me what you've done is in the history books there's never been anything like it then i won the primaries is that the same thing this is crazy now you're really in this i said no it doesn't matter unless we be hillary clinton and i mean peter it doesn't i will consider it and i shouldn't say this because you know what if it doesn't work out i could say well i did a good job it's all hurting myself by saying this if i don't win meaning that final stage beat 17 people because actually 17 including but it was actually 17 because there was one that we don't even talk about who joined you left very quickly one statement he was gone ok and then don't forget hillary had a couple of guys who dropped out and bernie was tough bernie was stuff we're gonna get a lot of the bernie brothers by the way because they didn't treat bernie right they didn't treat him right i mean i don't know bernie i don't do you know i don't know i never met him but they didn't treat him right honestly and what happened he'd been a very very good campaign and hillary's people just swamped him you're looking at debra wasserman schultz i'll take our rights over her anyday in terms of confidence forget it not for being nice or any of those things who cares i will take rights in terms of confidence over her believing any day any day you see what she's done to that party so i will tell you that i think we're going to get a lot of his voters because of the trade issue because they understand but because of the trade issue i think we're going to get a lot of their voters so i have to thank rights i want to thank steve king were steve king that's our local state where steve where thank you steve i want to thank some of our security guys first of all the secret services unbelievable yeah they've been hit a little bit over the last couple of years let me tell you these guys are fantastic i'm the best thing that ever happened to the secret service because i go around mark and all these guys i go around saying how great they are they are great these are great great people okay so i want to thank the secret service i want to thank the police of cleveland the cleveland police department the mayor i want to thank i want to thank you police chief he is amazing i don't know if he's here boy he has done some job working working with all of the folks from law enforcement and you heard less that would be protecting law enforcement they are doing some job so we're going to be protecting them i want to thank any dick where's that is any here i want to thank kevin schroeder keith schiller become famous because he's becoming more famous than me i have to thank and and again your police chief has done a fantastic job in cleveland done a fantastic and we have good in terms of some of the folks david gilbert was david david around someplace joe roman chris connor chris kelly these people are all here don't bother you don't have to come up and speak a bath bony with brian jack brian jack boy brian brian want a job you did brian ok that's so now you can leave go to the next location brian go to the next location hillary's trying to pick a vice president as fast as possible because he wants to take away a little of the success that we had at this convention this convention has convention has been a tremendous success you know people if you turn on television you sir you turn on some of the designers media you'll see that oh well this happened and that happened what happened you know somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people there wasn't one person along that one and then they said there may not be unity unity there wasn't one person in the room who was with including the texas delegation right honestly he may have ruined his political career i feel so bad i feel so ben and you know he'll come indoors over the next little while and coming into this because he has no choice but i don't want to endorse what difference does it make i don't want his endorsement i have such great and i don't want his endorsement just ted stay home relax enjoy yourself just a couple of things i knew his speech they gave me a speech i saw exactly what his speech was because when you go up to speak you have to give your speech you know we don't want surprises right so they gave it they came to me they said it's boring speech mr. trump nothing good nothing but he's congratulate you on the victory and here's the speech when he got up and the first two sentences he added a sentence in other words he got up and he added a sentence which could have been viewed as a nasty thing in terms of what he said because he was implying something which is wrong but that's okay so he took his speech and you're bound by that speech just like you're bound by the pledge right bound by the way so ted cruz took a speech that was done was on the teleprompter said hello then made a statement that wasn't on the speech and then went back to ass bitch see to me that's dishonorable to me not signing a pledge is dishonorable ok it's the sauna but not a nice thing to do and i talk this way because we're all together we created one of the most successful conventions in the history of conventions and the television ratings for this convention were through the roof i get a kick out of cnn i don't know if this is a successful connection all i don't in the meantime all they talk about is trump in the convention right and i have to tell you milania did a great job what a great water what a great speech and the presentation is still being talked about what a beautiful speech ivanka last night unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable to have that kind of an introduction and tiffany has never done at the biggest group she's ever been in front of this probably 22 people in a classroom tiffany was amazing and eric and don i just don't want them running for political office because somebody's going to stay behind and run the business i mean you know we can't go crazy but i get a kick because the ratings on television are through the roof and nobody's going to want to look out this has nothing to do with politics but maybe has a little to do nobody's gonna watch this next convention coming who didn't who's gonna i'm gonna have a hard time watching her final speech number one i know her too well number two boring boring very boring oh how about that final switch and our final speech our finals now it wasn't my fault but i think it went like an hour and 25 minutes and the network's didn't know what to do because they had all of their programming big program the local loses a very big factor on television you never ever move your local do they all moved it they said the heck with the local news mike they said we're moving and kimmel and fallon and the shows they all went back a long way because they weren't going to miss this convention i love that you know i love it i knew i said all was supposed to be off let's keep that but it wasn't my fault what happened what happened is the applause was so long and so crazy it really has i think if you look at the speech was fine but the applause for longer than the speech so i was it was a base there was great love in that room honestly that was all about unity and we may be missing a couple of people we may be missing just a couple of people and two other things to other things i just to finish with ted because i liked it he's fine again i don't want his endorsement if he gives it i will not accept it just so you understand i will not accept no matter honestly he should have done it because nobody cares and he would have been in better shape for four years from now if he's gonna be i don't think i don't see him winning anyway frankly but if he if he did i just fine although maybe i'll set up a super back if he decides to run are you allowed to set up a super back mike if you are the president to fight somebody but but there were two things that he said yesterday were lies ready i didn't start anything with the life a pack which is very friendly with relist released a cover story on my wife was as tremendously successful and elegant model and she was on the cover of gq magazine i think it was g cured a gq magazine's not exactly pen tasks but she was on the cover of gq magazine and artsy picture but you know that's why she was a model really successful she didn't need to marry me she was making a lot of money believe me like that work hard to get her to marry me wasn't that easy show don't you think i'm getting so so they released this picture which was you know to the people of the state of utah i love you too i love the people of utah but that's not what you want to necessarily send a risk a picture everybody and you talk about a picture and i don't think they showed that it was gq i don't even think they showed they took the gq off they just had they cut all the stuff that so they didn't see was a magazine cover from you know a reasonably respected magazine and who is melania trump now and i'm saying this just to clear it up because that's what you took it that i didn't do anything then when i saw somebody tweeted a picture milani and a picture of hiding who i think by the way is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman i have to tell you i think heidi cruz is a great person i'll i think it's the best thing he's got going in his kids if you want to know the truth in a certain way although he's got good intellect but he doesn't know how to use it and it was a good debater but he didn't do well in the debates against me according to every paul i'm in every poll you know just great the better except lost in every single poll and every single debate so that takes care of the hiding thing because heidi is a terrific woman but they sent out now he said that was a pack we had nothing to do folks a lot of us are political people right when our babies his people were on the pack so he said we had nothing to do we had this now probably you could trace it down with emails particularly smart they don't even said probably just phone calls but look it was a pact with many of his friends it was a cruise super back i think even said well wasn't really meant for us it was a cruise back it was his people ok so they sent out the first picture please remember this number to his father i don't know his father i met him once i think he's a lovely guy i think he's a little guy all i did is point out the fact that on the cover of the national enquirer there's a picture of heart him and crazy lee harvey oswald having breakfast now ted never denied that it was his father and study said donald trump i had nothing to do with it this was a magazine that frankly in many respects should be very respected they got oj they got edwards they got this i mean if that was the new york times they would have gotten pulitzer prizes for their reporting i've always said why didn't the national enquirer get the pulitzer prize for edwards and oj simpson and all of these things but anyway so they have a picture an old picture having breakfast with lee harvey us well now nothing is i'm not saying anything they said and here's how the process takes their story so this had nothing to do with me except i might have pointed it out but it had nothing to do with me i have no control over anything i might have pointed it out but they never deny did anybody ever deny that was the father did not say oh that wasn't really my father and slow hard to do was look like him so here's the story the press takes that they say donald trump and his conspiracy theories he won out and said his father was with lee harvey oswald and he assassinated the press why did i do so two things those with the two points so on those two points he said about the endorsement yet and and i just had cleared up i think i'm doing the right thing and doing it but i have to do it number one the id thing you understand now number two i know nothing about his father i know nothing about lee harvey oswald but there was a picture on the front page of the national enquirer which does have credibility and they're not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong ok a lot of money and there was a picture and that's the only thing i know so now they use the two things as the reason he won't support let me tell you something we for no other reason if people really just like me and i don't think they do any more after the four days hey look if i have kids that like me that much how bad can i be right right and they love their daddy i was a good father but i'm smart children and good children but and i'm getting a lot of credit i think they were the start of the convention mike i think they saved them i think they saved us mike but now my children were really i mean and they're saying people are saying that they were the star the real stars of the convention everyone moved there when i was so proud of them i mean it was such a great thing but to finish this was an amazing period of time this was an amazing convention i just heard a numbers dance covino there come up down for a second i just dance could be no feeling you might have seen him on twitter and facebook you know what he is he's a facebook twitter junkie this guy that was the first time i've seen him look up in seven months he's always looking down but nobody knows facebook and twitter and that stuff better than then why don't you give just a quick report because i hear the numbers are astronomical ladies don't you know we're dealing in a modern age i hate to do this a lot of people saying what facebook what's unfortunately we're dealing in a modern age how about giving a quick you want to hear this way did you hear the numbers you won't even believe it go ahead thank you president trump this is this is i got it i have to tell you hashtag trump train is everybody out there the truck train is all here right this this is surreal for everybody that's part of the campaign twitter last night exploded facebook exploded instagram exploded did everybody see the videos on mr. trump's twitter account instagram account facebook account i mean tens of millions of views we had over 85 million views on just those videos in about a 45 day period all right overhead almost half a million new followers on facebook mr. trump hit 10 million followers on twitter this this will never be done again it's impossible to be done again with this man right here it's absolutely impossible with his platforms a total of twenty two and a half million followers between instagram twitter and facebook 22 and a half million i don't know how you do this every day i this is insane impressions on twitter per month over 1 billion impressions on twitter and similar the numbers are going to come out for facebook they're gonna be probably in the billions it's absolutely unheard of so when mr. trump wants to get a message that we get those videos out and things are necessarily working out with cnn or somebody we can put it on his platform and get more views just on one of those social media accounts that mr. trump has which is at real donald trump on twitter donald j trump on facebook real donald trump on instagram and our next vice president of the united states is at mike underscore pence ok so please follow him as well he has a governor account but he's still the governor of indiana so let's just try and follow them they're all right give him some engagement we're going to be pushing out a lot of messages for the campaign there's a lot of people behind me it's not only me brad parce qu'elle justin mccarty this is a whole team so uh we love you this is actually awesome to come out and talk to the hashtag trump train let's make america great again thank you yeah yeah so one of my really good choices in life although i'll confirm that in about three and a half months from now but i believe truly it will be one of my really great decisions is picking mike pence to run along with the end to run and so i'd like to ask governor pence in the great state of indiana and we love indiana and bobby knight who i love and lou holtz and your wonderful you know gene from purdue we at mall and digger we got a lot of coaches out there but these guys are great people and they love mike and maybe mike can say a few words thank you we are so humbled and so grateful grateful to all of you the volunteers the people wearing the blue shirts the people that brought about the most exciting political convention of my entire lifetime thank you for your extraordinary work your tireless hours - all of those that did the work that did the setup that are doing the teardown now thank you so much thank you so much for creating a place where we could celebrate the kind of leadership that america is embracing more and more every hour as we move toward the november election but i just i just wanted to express a word of appreciation to all of you all of you who came here all of you who came alongside this good man and his family from early on in this campaign where we're so excited to be a part of this team my wonderful wife karen pence is with us today and we are getting the campaign trail together and i can just tell you i can just tell you having spent time with this man and his family and having seen his ability to connect and speak for the american people i say with absolute confidence if we work with all of our hearts for every day between now and election day we will make donald trump the 45th president of the united states of america and we will make america great again thank you and god bless you and let's go get it done yeah yeah thank you just one thing i want to leave you with supreme court justice no matter how much you like or dislike no matter what your feelings whether you're the governor of ohio whether you're a senator from texas or any of the other people that i be so easily and so bad you have no choice you got to go for trump supreme court justices if hillary clinton gets in she is going to replace and last night i called him our beloved justice scalia his back and we're gonna get somebody as close to him in his views and philosophy as possible conservative all the things you want the things we stand for as a party and i promise you that and that's why i issued 11 names because being an outsider they said all we don't know supposing you put a liberal judges i say i have an idea never been done before you know we have a lot of ideas that people don't normally have right i said i have an idea in order to secure really have a problem they didn't know if they believe me well we don't know what happens if we elect him and then he puts up liberal judges by the way are conservative republican presidents have been done so well with the judges have ok i mean we have obamacare should have been knocked out twice because of an appointment so we'll do better will do much better that's why i put out a list of 11 judges but no matter what you think of donald trump as a republican if that's what your philosophy is if you're a great great believer in the constitution you have no choice hate to say it whether you're a hater or a lover and by the way less that i don't think there was one hater in that room and that was a pact that was a pack there were no seats in those seats were selling for a lot of money on ebay they were going for a big numbers in fact i was thinking about taking about 10 or 12 tickets and saying let's go but they were selling for a lot of money and and it was an amazing so just remember supreme court justices now i just want to finish by this we've had some incredible support because when i started everyone said you know some of these pundits that now say oh well you can't do that you can these are the same people that say well if he runs but he won't run i ran and they said oh then they go but he won't win then i started off at six percent which is pretty high cuz i was only there for about two days people forgot so that was only two days i didn't get the full bath don't want to like 12 then went to 18 and every week isn't well that's just sealing and you can't do more than that so there we go from six right these i saw them in the audience's do so we go from six to twelve to eighteen and every week ago well that's this year charles krauthammer they will not run he will not run and if he runs he will just be doing it for fun this is not fun is a lot of work ok there's a lot of work folks i didn't need this this wasn't exactly the schedule but i saw how badly our country is doing and how easy it will be to bring back tracy feels alone will make an impact like you won't believe money will come in jobs will come in and then you look at the military were so depleted but we're taking care of other nations and i want to continue to take care of other nations there are a lot of good things about that but they have to pay us they have to pay when i remember years ago and i've always said wow i never quite understood because he said the united states spends ten times the money on its military than anybody else in the world and i said well china's a big military all these but that that's surprising but i know you know i was building buildings and things i never we give it too much thought and then i realized and i remember i always remember we spent so much more than anybody else i said how could it be we're protecting everybody in the world and we were protecting all these nations and these origination and they're great nations japan they send their cars they make a fortune and then they don't pay us the amount of course i want to make a profit the one cost pays what it costs maybe we can't get it if we can't see you have to be prepared to walk you have to if you're not prepared to walk hillary clinton came out what you are about what i said about japan japan is a very rich nation those cars are flowing in the rich because of us if you think about it okay those cars you got to los angeles you see these massive ships it looks like nascar by the way thank you brian france owner of nascar endorse donald trump i love nascar richard petty endorsed you all a lot of the great drivers endorsement king richard but they it's like it's like these guys driving like richard petty driving that they coming out of the boats these massive ships and they don't pay us and then a general gets up and the general says mr. trump is wrong doesn't he understand that japan pays us fifty percent of the cost of defending them all great shape mr. drop could we have a comment i say yeah why are they paying a hundred percent and germany and south korea we have 28 thousand soldiers and think of this one saudi arabia saudi arabia wouldn't be there for one week if we pulled out they have nothing but money nothing but might they have so much money that it didn't know what to do with it ok they don't know what to do with it who's making deals for us 1d like that has a massive impact on our budgets on our our economics as a country wept in nineteen trillion were very soon going to be 21 trillion dollars trillion nobody even knows what if i could take i could take the great harold him i could say tell me what a trillion dollars is although he's worth almost a trillion so he may know you may know but but you know honestly most people don't even know what they liked it so much they don't even know they would know how to define it so here's the story we are going to do something really special in our message code on when i started this we had all these pundits saying won't happen and a little staff corey lewandowski was great and i have to tape and he's been very loyal and he's been on cnn and he's really been fighting for me which is very nice and i really i respect that a lot hope ex was hope up coming home coming home get up here home ho pics the legendary open come on up here or come come sheesh i get her up here come on home come on hope we had a very small but tough team we had a small his hoe pics they're not gonna lift you over that barricade probably look at her she's very shy she's actually she's a very shy person but she's a great person she's done an amazing job and we had a staff of between george was our jewish come on over here come on fellas get over you just stand over here someplace get up get up in the day has come on i get help but you can't get through the secret service people here and what happened so we had a small staff and i got criticized for did say so and so i won't use them because i don't want to embarrass anybody so and so has spent many times what trump is spent and has a much bigger safe and then we win i don't get any credit supposed to get credit if you have smaller staff less payroll and you want but in politics you don't get cracking so anyway so i want to thank my entire group then we beefed it up because we're really now in the final stretch three and a half months and paul man afford has done an amazing job is here someplace where is called paul man afford oh good you made it fall man afford has done a fantastic and all of paul's people ball brought on staff and we really do we have a great staff of talented people a great

knows how to win and we've also have been winning all our lives this group of people in front of me i know so many of you we've been winning all our lives we've got exactly three months and three weeks i am going to be working so hard i'm not going to like last time where they disappeared for the last month and a half what happened where is everybody what happened and give obama credit he was on every television show he was all over the place we're not going to disappear so we have a really great chance of taking our country back of change and of getting great supreme court justices so i want to thank everybody i love you folks this has been such an incredible movement i love you i know so many of you we're going to go all the way and i'll tell you what when we get there we will indeed make america great again i love you thank you everybody once they suck down there after the next election they should be a little bit rattled when i could go on with a long speech about all the things that need to be done to help america become energy secure to grow our economy create jobs rolling back all of the regulations but i'm more interested in bringing the man up here who's gonna do exactly that please give a north dakota welcome to the next president of the united states mr. donald j because we love our farmers and we love right to it love our farm and we love agriculture so for the farmers out here you do an awfully good job and i've heard that for many years in north dakota so how loud now you can fall asleep our talk about it and she ok you know the farmers are great the miners are great the miners have been so badly treated and we're going to treat them really well you're gonna say so before we start i i really wanna thank harold hamm he's been a friend of mine for a long time he's an amazing man in the world of business yes it then he's been an amazing success story an amazing guy and i've learned a lot about energy from harold so harold and i've never seen you so happy when he got up here he became like i'm glad i didn't have to run against you herald and the congressman right from the beginning he was with us one of the few he was with us and the governor is in the audience whereas the governor governor thank you very much and your lovely wife thank you governor thank you very much and your entire self i appreciate you being here i also want to thank the delegates because i was coming out of my building this morning and it was a big news flash that donald trump had won the nomination and and i said what happened to wait a couple more weeks and they said no the delegates from your state right here in north dakota where are you where are you where my delegates that it stand up please so i guess you would call them unbound but now they have found you brought us over the line folks and i will always remember that i will always remember that and unbound doin outbound i think about you promised you bad everybody gets a brother so thank you very much is a great honor and this was a little bit sooner we were supposed to be watching hillary clinton and guess what we're watching hillary clinton that's the way it works cricket hillary but and at report yesterday that was a report let's talk about energy ok to be a north dakota state we're really are at the forefront of a new energy revolution oil and natural gas production is up significantly in the last decade our oil imports have literally frankly it cut in half that's something that nobody thought was going to be happening really for a very very long time but all of this occurred in spite of a massive new bureaucratic and political barriers president obama has done everything he can to get in the way of american energy for whatever reason he's made life much more difficult for north dakota as costly regulation and i mean serious regulation makes it harder and harder to turn a profit if cricket hillary clinton is in charge things will get much worse believe me you've seen it all you have to do is follow her career she was shut down energy production across this country and by the way she'll also unrelated abolish the second amendment and we're not going to let that happen that i can tell you that last week i got the endorsement of the nra and these are great people and i appreciate that endorsement millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of well will be destroyed as a result that's why this choice and this is a very important choice november going to be so so crucial and here's what it comes down too well serious well for people for workers for everybody vs poverty north dakota shows how energy exploration create shared prosperity better schools more funding for infrastructure which we really need throughout our country higher wages lower unemployment things we've been missing for a long time it's a choice between sharing in this great energy well or sharing in the poverty promised by hillary clinton you don't have to take my word for it just listen to hillary in her own words she's declared war on the american worker here's what hillary clinton said earlier this year we are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work by the way your timing wasn't so good the following week she went to west virginia she didn't do too well but i love the people of west virginia we did and i love the people of pennsylvania they don't like her too much i can tell you and if hillary shut down the minds she can really shut down our whole country and your business will be permanently in many cases permanently ruined so let me tell you how president obama undermined our crisis and our middle class the president stated that it was his intent to eliminate oil and natural gas production in america if you can believe this his policy is death by a thousand cuts through an onslaught of regulations for instance the environmental protection agency's use of totalitarian taxes forces energy operators in north dakota into paying on pred to unprecedented multi-billion dollar fines before a penalty is even control armed which is actually rather hard to believe government misconduct goes on and on the department of justice filed a lawsuit against seven north dakota oil companies for the death of 28 birds while the administration fast-tracked wind projects kill more than a million birds a year more than a million or drive to tell you the usa and wildlife service abuses endangered species act to restrict oil and gas exploration adding to the pain president obama now proposes a 10 per barrel tax produced oil in the middle of a downturn and you've had a downturn but we did hit $50 today i will take credit for that peril i want done for so i want 10% down at least at the same time i love you too think you at the same time president obama lives economic sanctions on iran he imposes economic sanctions on america he's allowed this country to hit the lowest oil rig count since 1999 producing thousands of layoffs towers america's incredible energy potential remains untapped it's totally self inflicted it's a wound and it's a wound that we have to heal under my presidency will accomplish a complete and lots of jobs lots of jobs imagine a world in which our phones and the oil cartel's can no longer use energy as a weapon when they've been nice very nice that happen if we weren't we gonna win for president obama has done everything he can to keep us depended on this is so important on others he wants us to be dependent on others it's different think it it's from a whole different school let me list some of the good energy projects that he's killed he rejected the keystone xlpe line despite the fact that would have created 42,000 jobs his own state department concluded that it would be the safest pipeline ever built in the united states and it would have no significant impact on the environment yet even as he rejected this and this is really something because we have that great relationship with canada so he rejected the america canada pipeline he made a deal that allows a ran make bad deals with iran to transport more oil through its pipeline that would have ever flowed through keystone with no environmental review whatsoever what are we doing president obama has done everything he can to kill the coal industry that we all know you just ask the people of pennsylvania as the people of west virginia look at what's happened there it's horrible here are a few of president obama is to create regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power play have blocked the construction of a prohibition against called production on federal and draconian climate rules that unless would effectively bypass congress to impose job-killing cap-and-trade a disaster president obama has aggressively blocked oil production of oil and natural you are you just take a look every single movies make is to block the production of oil and natural gas he's taken huge percentages of the alaska petroleum and you take the reserve he's taken it off the table he's taken it completely off the table oil and natural gas production on federal lands is down 10% which is pretty hard to believe eighty-seven percent of available and in the outer continental shelf has been put off limits totally atlantic lease sales were closed down to despite the fact that they would create listen to this two hundred and eighty thousand jobs and 23.5 billion dollars in economic activity president obama and the united states into the paris climate accords unilaterally and without the permission of congress this agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much our energy and how much we used right here in america so far and bureaucrats are gonna be controlling what we're using and what we are doing on our land in our country no way no way these actions have denied millions of americans access to the energy well sitting right under our feet well three didn't even know we had five years ago in 10 years ago this is your treasure and you the american people are entitled to share in the riches president obama's anti energy and this is really anti energy orders have also weakened our security by keeping us reliance on foreign sources of energy not gonna be for long folks not gonna be for long if i get it is a dollar of energy that makes someone else rich and really rich in some cases i wonder if their campaign contributors what do you think you think they probably gave to the clinton foundation i guess just seems just seems like that's what happened if president thank you darling i love you too president obama wanted to weaken america he couldn't have done a better job as bad as president obama is hillary clinton will be worse she will escalate the war against the american worker like never before and against american energy and she'll unleash the epa to control every aspect of our lives and every aspect of energy will make it impossible for the worker for the owners they'll make it impossible for everyone she declared that we've gotta move away from call and all of the other fossil fuel that's a quote we've gotta move away from coal quote all of the other fossil fuels locked in a way trillions in american well in march hillary clinton said by the time we get through all of my conditions i guarantee i do not think there will be many places in america where fracking will continue to take place what are we doing why are we even thinking what are we doing let's just vote around i don't know she's gonna get to run anyway what i'm saying you know like to run against imagine that she wants to close down a primary so's keep in mind shell energy production could add two million jobs in seven years yet well hillary clinton doesn't want american energy she is strongly in favor of foreign energy here is what you told china as secretary of state american exports and chinese experts will work to develop china's natural gas reserves is working with china what about working with us everyone's working with china they don't work with us we're going to work with us and we'll worry about china later folks ok unbelievable imagine what it would be for china if china unleashed its own natural gas reserves so you're not dependent on foreign oil hillary clinton has your priorities totally wrong but we are going to change everything around we are going to make it right believe me we're going to make it right very quickly at rupp administration will develop an american first energy plant america-first strokes america-first make america great again america-first make america great again firstenergy plan and i tell you here is how we're going to do it and here is how this plan will make america wealthy again american energy dominance will be declared a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the united states it's about america as 1.5 times as much oil as the combined proven resources as the combined proven resources of all opec countries we have more natural gas then russia a ren qatar saudi arabia come by we have three times more coal than russia are totally untapped oil and gas reserves on federal lands equal an estimated 50 trillion dollars we're loaded we didn't even know it well loved it we had no idea how rich we're richer than all of them were richer than all of them and we want to cherish that wealth by the way and preserve that wealth and take care of that well we will be comments a totally independent of any need two important energy from the opec cartel or any nations hostile to our interest anybody hostile to our interests believe me we don't deal with them will handle and just i just by the way there are plenty of them out there that are hostile to our interests at the same time will work with our gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy will work with them because we have to knock out terrorism and by the way we have to knock the hell out of isis we're gonna knock the hell out of eyes what that does to people feel so strongly about that when you see what's happening to our country when you have general patton and general all of our great generals then they're just right now spinning because they can't believe what's going on they can't believe that's going to turn around so fast folks you hedge rows we will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads about time our schools bridges and public infrastructure our infrastructure is crumbling our infrastructure is a disaster we have to rebuild our country we have to rebuild our country and we have to rebuild it properly and fast we've spent five trillion dollars in the middle east and we've got nothing for it we're in worse shape than we were fifteen years ago we've got a rebuild our country cheaper energy will also boost american agriculture will get the bureaucracy out of the way of innovation so that we can pursue all forms of energy this includes renewable energies and the technologies of the future it does include nuclear and wind and solar but not to the exclusion of other forms of energy and other forms of energy that right now are working much better the government should not pick winners and losers instead instead it should remove obstacles to exploration any market has its ups and downs but lifting these draconian barons will ensure that we are no longer at the mercy of global markets we never want to be there again at rupp administration will focus on real environmental challenges not the phony ones that we've been looking at will reject clinton's poverty expansion agenda that it reaches our friend i mean totally in riches are friends just take a look at our friends and makes everyone else very very poor will solve real environmental problems in our communities like the need for clean and safe drinking water and you look at some of our communities and they don't have clean and safe drinking water at all president obama actually tried to cut the funding for our drinking water infrastructure even as he pushed it increased funding for his epa bureaucrats american work will be the ones building this do infrastructure not people from other countries they're not gonna be building our infrastructure not even a little bit here is my 100th day action we're going to receive all the job-destroying obama executive action including the climate action plan and the waters of the united states rule ok i remember that we're going through a good as save that coal industry believe me when it is safe i love those people these are great people and they love that they love their job in west virginia have to say i said to some of the miners because they voted so overwhelmingly endorse me by so much i said would you ever think of leaving and going someplace else and doing something else they said mr. trump we love call this is what we do this is what we want to do they love it and we're gonna bring it back and we're going to help those people cuz that's what they want to do and it's unfair what's happened to him remember that very unfair so we're gonna save the coal industry and other industries threatened by clinton's extremist agenda and it is indeed an extremist agenda even worse than obama i'm going to ask transcanada to renew its permit application for the keystone pipeline the profits from that so that the american people can get some more money out of it is that makes us why not why not make it possible let's take a piece of the action for you folks you know lower your taxes a little bit more would-be self it without us i can't do it so it sounds like it makes a lot of sense to me we're going to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas we're going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies these technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before we're going to cancel the paris climate agreement and stop unbelievable and stop all payments of the united states tax dollars to un global warming programs we've got big problems we can't be sending our money all over the world to stop forty years ago twenty years ago we've got a lot of problems we're going to cherish your dollar we're gonna take care of $1 keep up money and we're going to keep our jobs here and went to bring jobs back ok remember that any regulation that's outdated unnecessary bad for workers or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped and scrapped completely we will also eliminate duplication provide regulatory certainty which is very important that trust local officials and local residents like yourselves any future regulation will go through a simple test is this regulation good for the american worker if it doesn't pass this test this rule will not be under any circumstances approved will be public and very very transparent they won't be made on hillary's private email account which is turning out to be a total disaster by the way i just for our country beyond hillary a disaster for a country that you do such a thing we're going to do all of this well taken proper regard for rational environmental concerns we're going to conserve our beautiful natural habitats reserve and so important we're going to take care of those habitats were gonna take care of our reserves and take such great care of our resources our resources so volatile within a take care of those resources in a truck administration political activist with extreme agendas will no longer write the rules that's what's happening now instead we will work with conservation is whose only agenda is protecting nature that's fine from an environmental standpoint my priority is a very simple clean air and clean water right hillary clinton will never do she will never be able to do this and i'm not just talking about this industry she will never create real jobs and real wage growth she can't do it she doesn't know how to do it her husband signed nafta one of the worst jobs one of the worst things ever signed in the history of our country for economic development they don't know how to do it and i think actually they don't even wanna do it according to the institute for energy research lifting the restrictions on american energy will create a flood of new jobs almost a seven hundred billion dollar increase by seven hundred billion dollar increase in economic output over the next thirty years more than a thirty billion dollar increase in annual wages over the next seven years some of the people that are my biggest supporters they haven't had a real wage increase in eight teen use k eighteen news think it and they work two jobs they're working harder than getting older they're working harder exposed to be the other way around not gonna be that way anymore over the next four decades more than 20 trillion dollars in additional economic activity at six trillion dollars in new tax revenue going to be generated the oil and natural gas industry supports 1080 yet high-paying american jobs and create another four hundred thousand new jobs per year this exploration will also create a resurgence in american manufacturing manufacturing so good to hear that is i've been going around clubs i've been going around and we won new york and we want all these states no matter where you go manufacturing down 50% down 55% i go down i see syracuse new york st rome new york that's the real run by the way i see all of these different places you at the bethpage you go out to then you go to pennsylvania you go to all of these different places and you see what was once vibrant beautiful work in places factories there all falling apart we lost 45 55 60 percent of our manufacturing jobs all over the place it's one of the reasons i one bisexual large margins because we're not gonna take it anymore we're not gonna take it anymore they're moving their leaving that taking our jobs said taking our companies were not going to let that happen anymore would dramatically reducing both our trade deficit a drug budget deficit compared this future to hillary clinton's venezuela south politics of poverty and that's what it is that's what's good in that pic that's where we're going that's the direction we're heading if you think about it not one idea of clinton has actually can create a single net job or create a single new dollar to put in workers pockets in fact every idea hillary has will make jobs disappear she doesn't have a true remember it was nap which was signed by her husband that destroyed this big parts of this country so hillary clinton's agenda is job destruction my agenda is job creation gonna create so many jobs and our country and go to another country there will be a problem for those companies there will be consequences there will be consequences and when they hear about the consequences you know what they're gonna do they gonna say mister president we've decided not to move that's what's gonna happen to simple as that tax and regulate our workers to the point of extinction true she wants terrible trade deals and she wants to continue terrible trade deals like nafta signed by her husband that will empty our manufacturing businesses even more so than they already are during her time as secretary is day which was a disaster she surrendered to china allowing them to steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property everybody knows that we do nothing about it she let them devalue their currency and then more than a trillion dollars to our trade deficit then there was libya secretary clinton's reckless libya invasion handed the country over to isis which now controls the oil in libya very very pure sweet beautiful oil among the best in the world has the oil from libya how'd you like that folks not so smart right the middle east that clinton inherited was far less dangers then the middle east she left with us today her reckless decisions in iraq libya a rare egypt and syria have made the middle east and more unstable than ever ever ever before the hillary clinton foreign policy legacy legacy is absolute total chaos clinton also wants totally open borders in america which would further plunge our workers into poverty hillary's open borders agenda means a young single mom living in poverty would have to compete for a job or a raised against millions of low-wage workers rushing into our country and we will have absolutely no idea who they are where they come from are they dangerous are they good are they bad we know nothing about these people my agenda will be accomplished through a series of reforms that put always america-first energy reform thank you sir energy reform that creates trillions of new dollars in wealth immigration reform that produces and protects our borders we are going to have such strong borders and by the way we want people to come into our country but they're going to come into our country legally legally legal and we are going to defend our workers we're going to defend our workers tax reform that brings millions of new jobs to america regulation reform that eliminates stupid rules that send our jobs overseas really created by people that don't even have a clue and if they do have a clue then they're doing some very very bad things to our country welfare reform that requires employees to recruit from the unemployment office not the immigration office we want to create jobs for our people very importantly trade reform that brings back our manufacturing jobs and stands up to countries that she and i mean she she liked dogs they cheat cheating are so badly and it's a disgrace and we have people that don't know what's going on in washington we have people that truly do not know what's going on there's one more thing we must do to make america wealthy again and you have to be wealthy in order to be great i'm sorry to say it will build the wall we're going to build the wall i was going to leave that one out for the energy speech but you know i never fails we will build the wall who's gonna pay for the wall mexico hundred percent 100% yet i was just testing you i want to see whether or not you on your toes we have to make our communities safe again violent crime is rising in our major cities across the country this is totally unacceptable every parent has the right to raise their kids in safety when we put political correctness before justice we heard those who have the least i mean that's what's happening we're really hurting the people that have the least it undermines their schools / is the value of their homes and drives away their jobs crime is a stealth tax it's a stealth tax on the poor it's a horrible thing and it's going up up look at the papers today look at the statistics look at what's happening with homicides in our country it's going only in one direction to those living in sheer i say help is coming it's coming soon will return law and order to america security is not something that should only in an and this is so important that should only be enjoyed by the very rich and the very powerful it has to be enjoyed by all by way of contrast i was endorsed and i told you this by national rifle and i see what's happening and i understand what's happening and i know it so well these

agenda that puts donors first or an agenda that put america first my agenda america-first always a choice between a clinton government of by and for the powerful and a return to government of by and for the thank you it is a choice between decline absolutely certain that line or a revival of america's great promise that people in charge of our government say things can change they just feel that things can change i've seen it for so many months now i've been doing this for 10 months am i doing a good job by the way for you i'm very proud of this i spent about fifty five million dollars of my own money but look at this i spent less than anybody else and i have the best did i want one of those i'd be done by a lot isn't that what you want for your president for at least a little while they want you to keep trusting the same people who betrayed you many times before i'm here to tell you that if you keep supporting those who have let you down then you will keep getting let down for the rest of your lives are prepared to kick the special interests out of washington d c and their seat of power over to you i will do that i actually look forward to doing that and it's about time to get there we will put the american people first again bill long time we will make our communities wealthy again we will make our cities say forget we will make our country strong again ladies and gentlemen we will make hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what's going on and especially how poor she do as president in these very very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism even her former secret service agent who seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and i will deliver that speech very very soon but today there's only one thing to discuss the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since sep tember eleventh and the worst mass shooting in our country's history so many people since i mean just hard to believe but just so many people dead so many people gravely injured so much carnage such a disgrace sahara is beyond description the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated and they will be forever likewise our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated we express our deepest sympathies to the victims the wounded and their families we mourn as one people for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack the worst was thank you our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of our long dose lgbt community they have been through something that nobody could ever experience this is a very dark moment in america's history a radical islamic terrorists targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country we need to respond to this attack in america as one united people with force purpose and determination but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly we're not acting clearly we're not talking clearly we've got problems if we don't get tough and if we don't get smart and fast we're not going to have our country anymore there will be nothing absolutely nothing left the killer whose name i will not use or ever say i was born in afghan of afghan parents who immigrated to the united states his father published support for the afghan taliban regime which murders those who don't share its radical views and they murdered plenty the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here that is a fact and it's a fact we need to talk about we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly we have an incompetent administration and if i'm elected president that will not change i will tell you that will not change over the next four years we have an administration that will not change but if i get in there it's going to change and it's going to change quickly we're going from totally incompetent to just the opposite believe me packing with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore we have to address these issues head-on i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great school and hank but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so and although the pauses temporary we must find out what is going on we have to do it it will be lifted this band when and as a nation we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country they are pouring in and we don't know what we're doing the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons now any class it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states and its as he or she deems appropriate hopefully it's he in this case thank you i will use this power to protect the american people when i'm elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats after a full tank and by the way we have no choice after full and partial and long really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions remember this radical islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-american i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people christian people jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence this is not just a national security issue it's a quality of life issue if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans women and children gay and straight jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores and is coming with these people folks it's coming we're importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people were letting into america all of the september eleven hijackers were issued visas large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis the boston bombers came here through political asylum the mail shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife the other terrorists from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly fivefold five fault in just one year according to pew research ninety-nine percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law we admit many more and that's just the way it is we admit many more from other countries in the region and i tell you what they share these oppressive views and values we want to remain a free and open society then and if we do then we have to control our borders we have to control and we have to control them now not later right now yet hillary clinton from months and despite so many attacks repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday and guess what she will probably save them she sort of has said them but let's see what happens she really has no choice but she doesn't want however she's really been force and she has been forced to say these words she supports and the reason is she supports so much of what is wrong and what is wrong with this country and what's going wrong with our country and our borders she has no clue in my opinion what radical islam is and she won't speak honestly about it if she does in fact no she's in total denial and her continuing reluctance to ever named the enemy broadcast weakness across the entire world true weakness i don't know if you know this but just a few weeks before san bernardino the slaughter that's all it was a slaughter hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam here is what she said exact quote muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism that is hillary clinton so she says the solution is to ban guns they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans abolishing the second amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns no good not going to happen folks not going to happen not gonna happen like she wants to take away americans guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us let them come into the country we don't have guns let them come in let them have all the fun they want i will be meeting with the nra which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror i will be always defending the second amendment ok thank you the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america and allowed to grow overseas and it is growing in fact hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic into immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life when it comes to radical islamic terrorism ignorance is not bliss its deadly totally deadly the obama administration with the support of hillary clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have just no intelligence gathering information we need this information so badly and he stopped it we don't have the support we don't have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job they are not being allowed to do their job and they can do it well better than anybody we need a new leader we need a new leader fast thank you they have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else i refuse to be politically correct i want to do the right thing i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again the days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if i'm elected as president i will give our intelligence community law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks and they don't have those tools now we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none second to none that includes better cooperation between state local and federal officials and with our allies very importantly i will have an attorney general a director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right not like it is right now it's not right we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states in september 11 nearly a year ago the senate subcommittee as president obama's department of justice state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states these departments refused to comply nobody even knows why they refused to comply president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since sep tember 11 so important the public has a right to know how these people got here how they came onto this great land why are they here we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs very simple we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america not complicated every and and just think of this take a look every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases just a single event and just one person can you imagine what they'll do in large groups which were allowing now to come here truly our president doesn't know what he's doing he's failed us and he's failed us badly and under his leadership this situation will not get any better it will only get worse and i've been saying that for a long time each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security in fact clinton state department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas having learned nothing from these attacks she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a five hundred percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country tell me tell me how stupid is that this could be a better bigger more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was all together under the clinton plan you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them were to report to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children not only their children by the way they're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system system - really - screen we're not screening people so why don't we have an effective screening system we don't were being left at all over the world the bird is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here we have cities we have inner cities we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states we don't know who they are they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership in which case they're out of here what i want what i want is common sense i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values that's a choice i put before the american people a mainstream in a great immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interest that's all it is we've got to get smart and tough and ridgeland and we've got to do it now because later is too late going to be too late for our country the media talks about homegrown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that's a very very important term a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it our imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it yes there are many radicalize people already inside a country as a result of poor policies of the past but the whole point is that we will be much much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem and that's what they're doing we're letting all of these people hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have for instance the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had and its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father was supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth why would we admit people who support violent hatred hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremist to our country and who suppress women gays and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values she can't have it both ways she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to impress these same communities how does this kind of immigration make our lives better how does this kind of immigration make our country better why does hillary clinton want to bring people in invest numbers who reject our values why explain ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the l be and lgbt community donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words i will tell you who the better friend is and someday i believe that will be proven out bigley and by the way the lbgt community is just what's happened to them is just so said and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is to disgrace to that community i will tell you right now clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women and they murder days i don't want them in our country immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities every single one of them america is already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth anybody in the world four times more at least because we don't even know who's coming in and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny not surprisingly wages for our workers haven't budged in almost 20 years you wonder why we get the crowds you wonder why we get this tremendous support you wonder why i've got more votes than any republican in any primary in the history of the republican party take a look at that take a look at your security but take a look at the wages for 18 years they've been stagnant they've even gone down so whether it's a matter of national security or financial security we can't afford to keep on going like this cannot afford it we owe 19 trillion dollars in debt and no longer have any options are communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief this is not an act of offense against anyone it's really an act of defense i want us all all of us to work together we have to form a partnership with our muslim communities we have muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership now the muslim community so importantly they have to work with us they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith i want to fix our schools i want to fix our bridges and our jobs market we're going to have it rock it again we're going to make great trade deals but i want every american to succeed including muslims but the muslims have to work with they have to work with us they know what's going on they know that he was bad they knew the people in san bernardino were bad but you know what they didn't turn them in and we had death and destruction hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens i want to protect our citizens all of our citizens the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault in san bernardino as an example people who know what was going on they know exactly but they use the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it they said all we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don't get in trouble we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what if eddie is their immigration status we have to know and we have to know fast we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with we need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us and we have an attack and people die these people have to have consequences big consequences america must do more much more to protect its citizens especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation as you just saw in orlando it also means we must change our foreign policy the decision to overthrow the regime in libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before these actions along with our disasters iran deal have also reduced their ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation-building no more nation-building it's never going to work and by the way we've spent almost five trillion dollars over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been a complete and total disaster were further away now that we were 15 years ago for instance the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya that mission helped unleash isis on a new cut i've said nato needs to change his focus and stop terrorism we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism since i've raised that criticism and it's okay i've got no credit for it but these are minor details nato has since announced a new initiative front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war we've tried it president obama's way doesn't work he gave the world his apology tour we got isis and many other problems in return that's what we got remember the famous apology to her with sorry for everything i'd like to conclude my remarks today by get expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders wherever they come from wherever they were born i don't care all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected thank you we're gonna be tough and we're going to be smart and when to do it right america will be a tolerant and open society america will also be a safe society we will protect our borders at home we will defeat isis overseas we have no choice we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety we will make america rich again we will make america safe again we will make america great again should one to check test one two testing mic check 12 everybody good it yeah yeah yeah yeah i yeah i yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah why yeah yeah yeah thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you for joining me today this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what's going on and especially how poor she do as president in these very very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism even her former secret service agent who seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and i will deliver that speech very very soon but today there is only one thing to discuss the

the wounded and their families we mourn as one people for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this thank you our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community they have been through something that nobody could ever experience this is a very dark moment in america's history a radical islamic terrorists targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country we need to respond to this attack in america as one united people with force purpose and determination but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly we're not acting clearly we're not talking clearly we've got problems if we don't get tough and if we

and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system system - really - screen we're not screening people so why don't we have an effective screening system we don't were being left at all over the world the bird is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here we have cities we have inner cities we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states we don't know who they are they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership in which case they're out of here what i want what i want is common sense i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values that's a choice i put before the american people a mainstream in a great immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interest that's all it is we've got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we've got to do it now because later is too late going to be too late for our country the media talks about homegrown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that's a very very important term a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it our imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it yes there are many radicalize people already inside the country as a result of poor policies of the past but the whole point is that we will be much much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem and that's what they're doing we're letting all of these people hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have for instance the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had and its founder and as its founder and immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father was supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth why would we admit people who support violent hatred hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues - support immigration policies that bring islamic extremist to our country and who suppress women gays and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values she can't have it both ways she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to impress these same communities how does this kind of immigration make our lives better how does this kind of immigration make our country better why does hillary clinton want to bring people in invest numbers who reject our values why explain ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the l be and lgbt community donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words i will tell you who the better friend is and someday i believe that will be proven out bigley and by the way the lbgt community is just what's happened to them is just so said and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is to disgrace to that community i will tell you right now clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women and they murder gays i don't want them in our country immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities every single one of them america is already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth anybody in the world four times more at least because we don't even know who's coming in and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny not surprisingly wages for our workers haven't budged in almost 20 years you wonder why we get the crowds you wonder why we get this tremendous support you wonder why i've got more votes than any republican in any primary in the history of the republican party take a look at that take a look at your security but take a look at the wages for 18 years they've been stagnant they've even gone down so whether it's a matter of national security or financial security we can't afford to keep on going like this cannot afford it we are 19 trillion dollars in debt and no longer have any options are communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief this is not an act of offense against anyone it's really an act of defense i want us all all of us to work together we have to form a partnership with our muslim communities we have muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership now the muslim community so important they have to work with us they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith i want to fix our schools i want to fix our bridges and our jobs market we're going to have it rocket again we're going to make great trade deals but i want every american to succeed including muslims but the muslims have to work with us they have to work with us they know what's going on they know that he was bad they knew the people in san bernardino were bad but you know what they didn't turn them in and we had death and destruction hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens i want to protect our citizens all of our citizens the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault in san bernardino as an example people who know what was going on they know exactly but they use the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it they said all we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don't get in trouble we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what if any is their immigration status we have to know and we have to know fast we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with we need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us and we have an attack and people die these people have to have consequences big consequences america must do more much one to protect its citizens especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation as you just saw in orlando it also means we must change our foreign policy the decision to overthrow the regime in libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before these actions along with our disasters iran deal have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation-building no more nation-building it's never going to work and by the way we've spent almost five trillion dollars over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been a complete and total disaster were further away now that we were 15 years ago for instance the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya that mission helped unleash isis on a new cotton i've said nato needs to change his focus and stop terrorism we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism since i've raised that criticism and it's okay i've got no credit for it but these are minor details nato has since announced a new initiative front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war we've tried it president obama's way doesn't work he gave the world his apology tour we got isis and many other problems in return that's what we got remember the famous apology to her with sorry for everything i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders wherever they come from wherever they were born i don't care all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected yeah thank you we're gonna be tough and we're gonna be smart and when to do it right america will be a tolerant and open society america will also be a safe society we will protect our borders at home we will defeat isis overseas we have no choice we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety we will make america rich again we will make america safe again we will make america great again thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you very much everybody yeah yeah yeah this is beautiful thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you very much what an honor we love denver do we all love denver yeah yeah thank you very much so we've had an interesting period of time we had a little bit of a good evening last night watching right well no so the numbers just came out for the big version they got big thursday where i spoke last week and hillary sometimes referred to as crooked hillary spoke last night she's cooking and we had i think it was 35 million and they had less like 33 or something in other words we had more and i've sort of been saying that and i have to tell you both numbers are great numbers don't forget on the debate it was 24 million that was a record so when you have 35 million people watching your convention those are big big numbers but the republican convention out drew the democratic convention on the big first and food right that's cool that's always good yeah always good oh so we have to go over some numbers because hillary was talking last night about how wonderful everything is she didn't talk about she didn't talk about all of the unbelievable long-term unemployment she didn't talk about the fact that house ownership is the lowest it's been in 51 years amazing that's a heck of a number who ever heard of that who heard of that she didn't talk about the fact that we had more police shootings over the last year then i mean nobody has ever seen anything like what's going on much over fifty percent over fifty percent from the previous year you know she makes it sound like everything's rosie dory it's not rosy tory folks people are pouring across the border we have no idea who they are people are coming in from syria and you see what's happening with nice and the beloved priest 85 year old priest he has his throat slip and dies and you know what our country has enough problems we don't need more problems and that's going to be more problems now you know should we read this snake should weigh does anybody know the steak ah should we do it ok who is heard it before because everybody says what you do it who's hurt this snake who has heard it let me put it differently who hasn't heard a lot of people okay before we do that we will do but i have to tell you so last night was sort of unbelievable i went home and i thought that hillary wasn't going to mention trump because i thought it would be a class thing to do she mentioned me 22 times to untreated the truth is it was a little bit on the boring side when you say as a speech it's like taking someone x so not a lot of people i don't think it registered we're going to see you know with the republican convention i got a very big bounce one of the biggest bounces in many years right we'll have to see well after so why does if she gets a good bounce if she does it but the speech was really lies you know one of the things she talked about was the rough-and-tumble campaign she talked about me you know this is this is a speech writer writing a speech and she read it and that's what it is and i hate to say this political wrote something which was interest política they kill me all the time very unfair but they wrote something they didn't give her high marks and they said it was shay after cliche and one of the things they said a tough and tumble campaign like a tough and tumble campaign now we have created a movement and the movement so nobody's seen well i mean look at this place nobody's seen anything like this what is that behind me that's that's pretty tough-looking that's pretty tough like but we've created a movement and everybody's that this is one of the great campaigns have ever seen i mean look you are the forgotten man and woman i was a guy that never did this before i've had great success i've enjoyed my life i have a wonderful family by the way did my family do a good job right yeah you know they were talking about the star power i saw the star power big star power we know about star power they were talking about the star power that they had at the democrat convention right it's actually you know it should be democrat convention sounds better when you say democratic but we may be shouldn't make it sound better so we should go with the democrat but they were talking about the star power let me tell you i take my kids have more star power i really do i think they think than anybody i said they had a general named john allen and he had never met him and he got up and he started talking about drop drop drop never met him and you know he is he's a failed general he was the general fighting isis i would say he hasn't done so well right not so well and they had other people what differences are big but i will say this look we have i mean that was hit after hit after him oh and i said you know when one of them i said i'm going to hit them back so hard right i'm gonna hit them back so hard and i'll do it verbally i'll do it on television i'll do it on twitter now we have between facebook and twitter and a couple of other 22 million people can you believe it that's a force that's a force 22 million and the last day i think we picked up a hundred thousand so we have a force but i said we're gonna hit them back so hard and cnn put on trump is going to hit them i mean i'm going to hit him with this with the with the lips i'm gonna hit him verbally they put out of think drug hitting you never sell people these people are so dishonest there so just says but i'm going to him heart so a friend of mine calls me up and he's a governor is a great governor highly respected i said you know we had guys at people that said really bad things about me and he said donald don't do anything you got the nomination you're going to beat hillary clinton focus on hillary clinton now but i said but you know i really want to hit them i don't mean this i mean this right i really want to hit them we're going to do a verbal lashing on them and he said don't do it don't do it don't do so maybe i'll do it just a little bit breath right i'll do it just a little but we just left to other parts of colorado at which is a great state i'm here a lot anyway even without this stuff i have so many friends here and we have to win this state or november a we have to have yeah and i'm going to be here a lot fact i'm going to be here so much that you people are going to say please okay will vote for you don't come back anymore right well have some fun but i i enjoyed watching it last night somebody said how is hillary how did she do average i've been that bad not bad not good a lot of shouting accessories not the most exciting speech 11 he said not the most exciting whose speech was better mine or hers well they say that but you know what they say about my knee haters the ones that don't want me to you know do well the haters these people see the designers people back there the world's most deserted they are the world's most dishonest me look shawn the crowd over there cameras showing the crowd shown the crowd showing the crown and this is my third one today you think this is fun do you think so but actually actually i've got to be honest with you i'm actually having a great time we have great people in this country we have unbelievable people and we are going to make america great again yeah yeah i i gotta kick last night go ahead usa yeah you know you hear that sound how it sounds like it you're watching a big football game right denver 15 good defense good defense and you know what john elway is a great guy i play golf with him a long time ago he is long he's strong he's a long hitter but he's a good guys done a great job great defense i think you're gonna do great read but but my wife will always say darling did you have a big crowd tonight and she said because they never show the crowd but boy it sounds it you can't imitate that noise with a hundred people you know yeah mazal you can't imitate that lets go the real deal no matter where we go we have crowds the crowds are only restrained by the size of the buildings and sometimes i mean now we're using an air museum good place i guess right good but it's only restrained by that so when i heard some of the statistics last night and i enjoyed some i thought chelsea two nite chef you know chelsea likes evanka and evanka like chelsea i wish they didn't like each other but they do it's easier if they don't like each other you would think that relationship would be strained but they like each other and i think chelsea did a nice job last night okay i really did okay but listen but hillary now that's another subject and hillary said all sorts of wonderful things like we're doing great so here are numbers that came out today alright this came out just a little while ago today we got new growth numbers one-point-two percent for the second quarter growth wait this is the weakest recovery in modern history oh did she say that last night i don't think so yesterday i said this before the rate of homeowners your people that own their homes is the lowest level it's been in 51 years that hillary say that last night of this under president obama i like that better keep the lights off i just went down 20 degrees wow and the audience is even bigger than i can see the audience oh i like that i miss my protesters i missed my protesters you know my protesters they were really bernie protesters they were really bernie protesters thank you i look at that look at that it's the remnant of a bernie protester the final remnant that's okay so did you see party last night how angry he was i don't like to see that it's bad for your help he was so angry they were talking about him and he was scowling and his wife put her hand on his shoulder and he didn't move and she took it off because she could see you know why he sold his soul to the devil he sold his soul to the devil he shouldn't have made that deal and as soon as she picked this vice president tim can you know what his first booth was in virginia to raise taxes by four billion dollars of the first way and unemployment almost doubled in virginia while he was governor and he's not popular in virginia now and we're gonna win virginia because i think we're going to win i have a lot of property in virgin i have a lot of property a lot of employees i pay them a lot of money we're gonna win in virginia but i think it should pick somebody that was popular they don't like him in virginia but he raised taxes by four billion dollars in the first week when he was governor and unemployment doubled i don't think that's a perfect candidate ok i don't think so i like our candidate right governor mike pence indiana's does so well we like mike we do we do mike is a great guy ok so the rate of homeownership is the lowest it's been in 51 years president obama during his term has doubled our national debt we're going to very soon be up to 20 trillion dollars the us trade deficit these are things that to the best of my recollection you have a very good memory people know me for my memory or i couldn't do this without teleprompters right hilary hilary teleprompters yeah you know she's got ten people in the room she's got a teleprompter oh boy so listen to this listen it is the us trade deficit in goods reach nearly 800 billion dollars last year 800 billion we have a trade deficit of nearly 800 billion i don't think so did hillary mention that last night once you said how well did hillary mention about all of the police and we love our police and we love our law enforcement yeah did hillary mention about all of the police that have been shot i don't think so did hillary you know did you see the first night there was no american flag right the second night there was no american flag and then i sort of put out the word there's no americans like so they ran up with a play they ran up and i really want the flag but they ran up the next night that a few flecks and then the final night you know they overdid it there's so many flags you could walk on the stage they overdid it but that's like the police they didn't mention the police they mentioned everybody put the police and then people started writing stories they didn't mention the place and they mentioned final neck ok long-term unemployment is the worst it's been since the nineteen forties did hillary mention that last night unbelievable numbers 28.2 think of this one oh wow it's too depressing should i read it yeah why they're twenty three point eight million americans in their prime earning years are now out of the labor force that good another 14 million americans left the labor force nearly four in ten african-american children are living in poverty while fifty-eight percent think of this fifty-eight percent of african-american youth are not employed fifty-eight percent obama's done a great job hasn't median in i mean think of this median household income has fallen by more than four thousand dollars four thousand dollars we have people standing in this room who made more money in real wages 18 years ago then they're making today they didn't work as hard there were a hell of a lot younger it should be the other way around and we lost our jobs we lost our companies and we're not going to let it happen anymore we're going to get our jobs back we're going to bring our company's back we're not going to let companies leave us anymore not without repercussions it's terrible i've been its arab look these are all statistics i could go on and on like this five pages i don't want to pressure you okay don't forget they said that donald trump's speech i thought i delivered it well they were very that every but what they did no they said he was great but what they did is they said it was dark see that was the way they said it was dark but actually it was it dark it was optimistic because i talk about the problems and we're gonna fix the problems like as an example radical islamic terrorism is a problem big problem that's a big problem radical islamic terrorism hillary didn't discuss that to my track so we're bringing in thousands of people from syria we don't know who they are we don't know where they come from there's no paperwork there's no way of really vetting them and they're being placed here and all over the country and mostly the officials don't even know where they're placing them because it's supposed to be a big beautiful secret it's not a big beautiful secret and hillary clinton has stated very strongly now she'll change just like now she wants to try and renegotiate trade deals after she heard i want to renegotiate our trade deals now all of a sudden after 30 years she wants to renegotiate read this all right her husband sign after the worst trade deal in the history of the world not just disgusting so hillary clinton wants to increase syrian migrants coming into our country that we don't know who they are by five hundred and fifty percent no way no way but you know i do laughs because she's on a new kick and the new kick is you know i call her bad judgment she's bad judgment everything she touches is not good you look at libya you look at the migration you look at syria you look at the aranda what she started you look at every single look at benghazi what happened there remember the three o'clock in the morning commercial remember who do you want at that phone at three o'clock in the morning i don't want hurt that phone then then she lied like a dog on her emails she lied like a dog or emails she showed great negligence at the real world is negligence in what happened she put us all at risk she put us all at risk here's a secretary of state with a server come so i'll tell you what i'd rather do honestly i'd rather just november eight feet hurt the polls we got a beater she would be a disaster remember this justices of the united states supreme court whoever the next president is you're going to have at least two probably three could even before and might be five it may be the all-time record in the history of the presidency appointments to the united states supreme court if she gets her appointment we're going to be venezuela we're going to be venezuela so we can't do that one thing one thing i have to say so i was telling you about bernice in so we have the all-time story they say that it's one of the great stories in the history of politics what happened because what's happened here is great but the same thing is happening no matter where we go to wee-wee i'm the messenger no matter where and you know i'm the messenger are being spark of common sense of not being ripped off by every country in the world with a message of having strong borders would anybody like to see the wall get built yeah hundred percent under person hundred-percent hundred-percent it gets built you know these politicians come up to me and they go donald i don't understand you can't build a wall really can you you know we build 95 story buildings you can't build a wall really can you you see that ceiling up there that's pretty i still have pretty much i would have to go much higher than that that's up there right at usually i'm looking at the ceiling that slope them we're going on a lot taller than 12 that's something that looks like it would be a good solid wall anybody anybody that gets up isn't coming down so easily right now we're going to build a wall but these politicians come up to me and they say you really can't build a wall you're just kidding aren't your saddle kid i don't care i don't care let me tell you we're going to build a wall and then i explained to him that 2,000 years ago the great wall of china was built and it's 13,000 miles long we need 1,000 miles and we have caterpillar tractors right how easy is this we have a lot of natural borders we have a lot of natural stuff we're going to need about a thousand miles and let me tell you that's going to go up so fast your head will spin your head will spin and you know i was endorsed i was endorsed by the border patrol agents first time in the history 16,500 border patrol agents i was endorsed by the great chef joe arpaio the great nobody does better the gerroff job nobody knows better the joy of joe and he endorsed me we have tremendous endorsements but i'll tell you look i said to the top people when they called and they said mr. trump were endorsing you said that's good how many ppl 16,500 mr. trump they're not doing the job they're not letting us do our job i said how important is the wall they said mr. trump the wall is vital it's a great tool it'll end up being our best tool for protection we have to stop the drugs from coming in we have to stop illegal for pouring across up order so what you know let me tell you one of the interesting things so the president of mexico was being interviewed and he said that he was the past president and he said there's no way they're going to build and then you know what happened he used the f bomb i couldn't believe it on live television on that station right there he used the f bob no no no he used the f bum and i said i can't believe it always be in trouble he's can you imagine if i use the f bump it would be over it would be over so we use the up on me said that wall will never ever pub dead belt and i said that's great news because before they were going like so many different levels now he's saying it's not going to get paid for by them here's what's gonna happen we're going to build the wall mexico is going to pay for the wall a hundred percent one hundred percent we're going to stop the drugs from pulling into our country and poisoning our youth we're going to stop people that aren't supposed to be here from coming into our country that is going to happen so people like this and i've done it a few times people like it and this was actually a song written by al wilson quite a while ago and i heard this and i said this really pertains to what we talk about when we talk about illegal immigration and i said you know let me do this and i read it a couple of times of people love it should i do it so it's called the snake so remember this pertains to people coming across the border this pertains to people coming in from syria that we have no idea who they are remember they cut the heads up people they drowned people in steel cages by that by the thousands they're drowning people 25 at a time and steel cages they're cutting off heads this is like medieval times and then they say to me doing one of the debates they talk about waterboarding i say i'm okay with it up sorry i'm sorry can you imagine can you imagine you know waterboarding so it became famous you know why because they felt it was just short of torture you know that right it wasn't real i'm not saying its pleasant but believe me it works how about these guys and say it all doesn't work ok it works so they asked one of the debates they asked ted cruz he was standing right alongside adam what do you think that he was very uncomfortable with the question then they went by the way was that was that a display of love speaking of ted cruz when they pulled him off that stage no seriously when they put him off that stage the entire texas delegation food him off that stage let me tell you say what you want they didn't cover it that way cause they're so dishonest but that's when you knew the party was united this party is united right right his party is really other than a few guys who you know let's face it it was the toughest they say primary ever fun number one we had 17 people 17 and number two we had trump and trump we have to win we have to win remember remember when i came in and these pundits one of them sitting back there now these pundits said you will never won you will never run turn around he said one then i said but he will never do good and he's just doing it for fun he's just having a good time i mean it's a hundred and twenty degrees under those crazy lights it's late it's right you know what time i get home tonight for our truck in the morning it's fun but it is fun because we're gonna do something that has never really been done before in this country when bill o'reilly spot guy tough guy and others say it was the single greatest political phenomena that he's with this in his lifetime he's seen a lot that's what happened that's what's happened so remember and we started off at six percent and these pundits that get paid a lot of money and they're usually wrong but they said hi you got six percent that i realize only had two days of the week i started late everybody else was in and they said huh got six percent well that will be his ceiling six percent six percent will be his ceiling and that's okay you know they speak with security so donald trump get six percent the first week next week i get twelve percent ah he got twelve percent little higher than i thought but that will be his ceiling he will not go higher than that next week i get eighteen percent that i get twenty two percent then i get twenty-five percent 27-percent thirty percent 32 present thirty-six percent then i get 38 person and every single time they say that will be soon but now when i'm hitting thirties and everyone else is low really low like you know two percent what percent 0% about the zeros you had some zeros that means out of millions and millions of people nobody voted for nobody go home get out ok go and they were among the masses of people can you believe they were the nastiest ones the ones that 0 anyway so i had thirty eight percent and then i had 42 and i'll never forget one of the people i had forty two percent and there were like 10 people left temple and they said he had forty two percent but he cannot break 50 how many times he cannot break fifty percent he cannot break fifty percent i got ten people senators governors i be ben carson who by the way is a great guy he adores me we love that smart smart come quick ben carson so i get forty two percent and i have these idiots saying he may have forty-two percent but he goes enough 50 but we have 10 people left so here's the story we then get more and more and more we do a number and i'll tell you what it's a great great feeling but a lot of feelings were hurt because people say it was the nastiest the mean is the hardest primary ever fought in the history of our country that they know of i mean i mighta been tougher before television but how could it be because when you can say something in television you reach everybody at one time there's something awfully nice you call somebody a certain name and everybody years that what time so look so some of these people haven't recovered but slowly but surely marco rubio he adores me last week strong endorsement you know that he's a good guy and he's running in florida for the senate is running and he's going to win and i'm gonna win in florida but i gotta win here i gotta win so so now i start off here i get here and they're all sort of like saying but trump never did this before and then one of the people that was running has been out of office for a while and they said but he hasn't been off in office for eight years and they don't say that about dropping i've never been in office so they gave overpass they don't give me a pest but we end up getting this now we're down to the final stroke so i get a call from a big report a very big the biggest happens to be a slight liberal tent but that's okay and he said how does it feel because what you've done because we have crowds like this every time what you three times a day what you none has never been done before and i say no i disagree with that i i think unless i what he says no no it doesn't matter whether you win or lose you will be in the history books for what you've done and i said let me stop you right there if i don't win meaning if i don't be crooked hillary clinton she is as crooked as a three-dollar bill if i don't be drunk and hillary clinton i will consider this a tremendous waste of time energy and money believe me i'm not looking to be in history books unless it's at the top where we do something great and that's what we're gonna do we're gonna make our country great again but we're gonna make america safe again safe again so so so i found this it's not a lot of people know it but i think it's terrific and remember this has to do really with syrians coming across and just so you understand i have a big heart i want to build safe zones in syria for the syrians i want to get the gulf states to pay for it because they're not doing anything right now and without us they wouldn't be there for two minutes and they have nothing but money nothing but money we are 20 trillion dollars we don't need you know i put my developer had we're going to use other people's money right and we're going to build safe zone at those safe zones are going to be funded by other countries nearby that have lots and lots of money and we'll supervisor but think of this so this is people coming in we don't know who they are but we do know that it's going to be trouble it's only a question of when on her way to work one morning down the path along the leg a tender hearted woman so i have frozen really beautiful stick oh well she cried i'll take you in and i'll take care of you now you have to understand folks this is a snake that's in bad shape and you have this really nice woman and she goes a tender hearted woman saw a half frozen steak his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the do oh well she cried i'll take you in and i'll take care of you take beano tender woman take me in for heaven's sake take be a no tender woman side with the broken snake she wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk now she heard home from work that night as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snakes he taken in had been revived take piano tender woman take me in for heaven's sake take me in oh tender woman side the broken now she clutched him to a bosom you're so beautiful subscribe but if i hadn't brought you in by now you certainly might have died now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight but instead of saying thank you that snake k / a vicious bite take me in oh tender woman take me in for everyone's sake take me in oh tender woman inside the vicious snake i saved you tried that woman and you've bit be heavens why you know your bite is poisonous and now i'm going to die oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin you knew damn well i was a snake before you took be in that's where we are that's where we are right that's where we are you watch you watch so we don't want to be the stupid country anymore we want to be the smart country we're going to make great trade deals i read the numbers with grade eight hundred billion dollars in trade deficits last year with china alone the greatest abuser of a mole and i don't hold it against china china's great i love china i do business with china i have the largest bank in the world as a tenant in one of my buildings in manhattan it's a chinese bank it's the biggest in the world we sell condos the bank of america building in san francisco is mine with a partner 1290 avenue of the americas one of the biggest buildings in manhattan is mine with a partner all comes through china we can do great with china but we have stupid people representing us stupid stupid people so here's what's going to happen we are going to build and bring our best look we have the greatest business people in the world better than any place else we don't use we use political hacks some of these business people are not nice people who cares you care i don't think so some of these people are vicious horrible miserable human beings who cares who cares some of these people they don't sleep at night they twist and turn and sweat and their mattress is soaking wet because they're thinking all night about victory the next day against some poor person that doesn't have a chance and these people unfortunately high noble these people would love to represent us against china against japan against all of these countries mexico where they're killing us at the border and they're killing us in trade we have a massive trade deficit with mexico not including the drugs that go back and forth by the billions that's not including the drugs we have the greatest business people in the world they would do it for nothing they still love this country they feel crazy they feel so angry they can't believe the deals are made we can do things that have never been done before will stay open trade you know one of the reporters asked me a couple of weeks ago mr. drop do you believe in free trade i said yeah i believe in free trade i believe in fair trade i believe in ten other forms of trade but the bottom line if you really know my deal is that i just don't want labels i want to make great deals with individual countries for our country so that we create jobs and we takin money basically i want great deal that's what i want and that's what will happen so free trade interesting free trade is wonderful but to have free trade we need smart people on our side we don't use their smart people or we use people that are totally controlled by lobbyists and special interests like hillary clinton hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street now i put up almost 60 million for the primers which sounds like a lot of money but believe me other spent 200 million and they lost what would you rather do would you rather be on the side of of the person who spent the least funny and one for the most money and loss to do want is your president ok i mean we had people that spent much more money than me and they came in seventh place i spent relatively little money i put it up myself add came in first place but not only first place 13 million people is the highest vote total in the history of the republican party and i one massive amounts of state so we run the table read the table is a beautiful thing but look look we want to have free trade and our companies want to deal but you know the china since all this stuff in we can send our stuff to china we can't free trade and the currency manipulation is unacceptable and then on top of everything else in the south china sea they're building a massive military fortress that they're not supposed to be building because they have absolutely no respect for us so all of that's going to change so here's the story is the story you're ready we don't win anymore as a country we used to win you know what i was in school like in high school they say we never lost a war our country never lost a war we never lost anything now we only lose we go and we fight these wars like iraq we should have never gone and i was against it from the beginning i said you destabilize the middle east but i was a business guy nobody cared but it was just common sense you had iran and iraq always fighting always fighting nobody moving because they were the same power then we decimated one power now iran will take over iraq they've already essentially taken over wreck and we made them we made it possible for them than walking okay so here's the start we don't want any more but we're going to start winning again our military is depleted we're going to build it up it's going to be a thing of beauty we're going to get other countries and we're going to knock the hell out of isis believe me we have no choice we as part of our military are going to take great care of our wonderful veterans that be treated terribly we're going to start winning with trade we're going to make great trade deals we're not gonna let terry your air conditioner and ford and all of these other companies we're not going to let them go to mexico and other countries fire all their people make their product that send it back into our country and solid eyes we get unemployment and no taxes no when they make their product and they want to leave and they want to fire our great people they can go and i wish him luck but when they send their product back into our country they're going to pay attacks of that product at a substantial tax and they'll never ever leave in the first place they're never going to leave in the first place ok they're never going to leave in the first place sarah so we're gonna make great races we're going to save our second amendment which is totally under see ok totally we're going to repeal and replace obamacare so much less expensive summer we are going to terminate the whole common core and you can educate your children local we're going to have powerful beautiful strong borders and people are going to come into our country but they're going to come into our country legally legally legally and we are going to start winning again we're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning we're going to make the denver broncos look like a team that doesn't even do so well by our winning percentage ok we're going to win with trade we're gonna win at the border we're gonna win with the second amendment we're going to win with education we're going to win with a military we're gonna win for our vets we're gonna win for our vets and all of my friends in denver and all of my friends in colorado you're gonna come and you're going to say mr. president we'd like to meet with you in the white house because mr. president you're winning too much it's no good mr. president we're not used to it in our country we never won and now you're winning too much mr. president so please don't win so much and i'm going to say i'm sorry we're going to keep winning

america safer safer safer than ever before thank you very much i love you thank you for a wonderful go out and vote november eight yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ok welcome you to this event today on behalf of both the national interest and the center for the national interest featuring a major foreign policy speech by donald trump today our moderator will be a distinguished former ambassador zalmay khalilzad odd was both an immigrant from afghanistan the united states and has compiled a quite astounding record serving at the highest levels of the american government and i'm grateful to him for now greeting thank you very much jacob and my recently published member the envoy i tell the story of coming from afghanistan a teenager and of my later service as a us diplomat in afghanistan iraq and the united nations analyzing what we did right and drawing lessons for the future america gave me an opportunity to succeed and i tried to pay back a little by my service to the united states i mentioned my book i would like everyone to read it and to borrow a phrase from mr. trump it will make your head spin today as the primaries wine down donald trump delivers a much anticipated speech on his foreign policy philosophy this is a critical moment for america and for the world since the end of world war two some 70 years now the united states has supported a world order that has precluded war among the major powers we have prevented hostile header months from dominating critical regions asia europe and the middle east we did so by maintaining a favorable balance of power by creating expanding and sustaining strong alliances and by seeking areas of cooperation and record and reconciliation with rivals but why war among major powers have been precluded we have been embroiled in several costly and protracted conflict and the world has become more complex unstable and dangerous one in which rival powers are more aggressive hostile regimes are pursuing weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons long-range missiles and cyber capabilities and the threat of terrorism and extremism is acute indeed the international order the state system created by the west itself under attack by revisionist states and rising powers with alternative concepts of order as often seen in our history after a period of great exertion during the first decade of the 21st century post 911 we are now in a period of withdrawal and retreat and things can still get a lot worse we have a sluggish economy growing inequality rising that and that service our infrastructure is attention and the demand for domestic program is growing pressure is rising to reduce expenditure on national security at a time when we need to pay more attention to our security needs against this backdrop the presidential primaries have shown that our country is deeply conflicted and polarized about america's purpose and mission around the world mr. trump has been a provocative voice in this debate is message has resonated with a significant part of our electorate the national interest has invited mr. trump to elaborate upon his distinctive views about america's role in the world and explain how he would lead america as commander in chief we will extend similar invitations to the other candidates we're delighted mr. trump is here please joining me please join me in welcoming him thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the center for national interest for honoring me with this invitation it truly is a great honor i'd like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peace it's time to shake the rust off america's foreign policy it's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fault something we have to do the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principal my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all s has to be first has to be that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make america america first will be the major an overriding theme of my administration but to chart our path forward we must first briefly take a look back we have a lot to be proud of in the nineteen forties we saved the world the greatest generation beat back the nazis and japanese imperialists then we saved the world again this time from totalitarianism and communism the cold war it lasted for decades but guess what we won and we won big democrats and republicans working together got mr. gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan are great president when he said tear down this wall history history will not forget what he did very special special man and president unfortunately after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya to president obama's line in the sand and syria each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper very bad it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy we tore up what institutions they had and then we're surprised at what we are at least civil war religious fanaticism thousands of americans and just killed lives lives lives wasted horribly wasted many trillions of dollars were lost as a result the vacuum was created that isis would fill iran to would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment they have benefited so much so sadly for us our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster no vision no purpose no direction no strategy today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy first our resources are totally overextended president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy he's crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low-growth a huge trade deficit and open borders are manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching 1 trillion dollars a year we're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength i'm the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem i'm the only one believe me i know them all i'm the only one that knows how to fix it secondly our allies are not paying their fair share and i've been talking about this recently a lot our allies must contribute toward their financial political and human costs have to do it of our tremendous security burden but many of them are simply not doing so they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us in nato for instance only for of 28 other member countries besides america are spending the minimum required two percent of gdp on defense we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes missiles ships equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and if not the us must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves we have no choice the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully thirdly our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us we've had a president who dislikes are friends and bowels to our enemies something that we've never seen before in the history of our country he negotiated disastrous deal with iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon cannot be allowed remember that cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and under a trump administration will never ever be allowed to have that do clear weapon all of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran's treatment of our 10 captured sellers so vividly i remember that day in negotiation you must be willing to walk the iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table when the other side knows you're not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to win you can't win at the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them you've made that agreement you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place president obama gutted our missile defense program then abandoned our missile defence plans with poland and the czech republic he supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a long-standing peace treaty with israel and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in his place israel are great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity just a few days ago vice president biden again criticized israel a force for justice and peace for acting as an inpatient piece area in the region president obama has not been a friend to israel he's treated i ran with tender love and care and made it a great power iran has indeed become a great great power in just a very short period of time because of what we've done all of the expense and all at the expense of israel our allies in the region and very importantly the united states itself we've picked fights with our oldest friends and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help remember that not good fourth our rivals no longer respect us in fact they're just as confused as our allies but in an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously anymore truth is they don't respect us when president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there nobody to greet him perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one then amazingly the same thing happened in saudi arabia it's called no respect absolutely no respect do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen denmark to get the olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the united states came in fourth fourth place the president of the united states making this trip unprecedented comes in fourth place he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment we were left at all over the world as we have been many many times the list of humiliations go on and on and on president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage in china necessarily to rein in north korea we have the leverage we have the power over china economic power and people don't understand it and with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea which is totally out of control he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the united states and its companies we've let our rivals and challenges think they can get away with anything and they do they do at will it always happens if president obama's go had been to weaken american he could not have done a better job finally american no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals since the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union we've lacked a coherent foreign policy one day were bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians the next day were watching the same civilians suffer well that country falls and absolutely falls apart lives lost massive money is lost the world is a different place where humanitarian nation but the legacy of the obama-clinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarray a mess we've made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide we have done nothing to help the christians nothing and we should always be ashamed for that for that lack of action our actions in iraq libya and syria have helped unleash isis and where the war against radical islam but president obama won't even named the enemy and unless you name the enemy you will never ever solve the problem hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country after secretary clinton's failed intervention in libya islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans then instead of taking charge that night hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep incredible clinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a total lie proven to be absolutely a total lie our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state mislead the nation and by the way she was not awake to take that call at three o'clock in the morning and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil and you know what we don't blockade we don't bomb we don't do anything about it it's almost as if our country doesn't even know what's happening which could be a fact and could be true this will all change when i become president to our friends and allies i say america is going to be strong again america is going to be reliable again it's going to be a great and reliable ally again it's going to be a friend and again we're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies we're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world are moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge we need a new rational american foreign policy informed by the best minds and supported by both parties and it will be by both parties democrats republicans independence everybody as well as by our close allies this is how we won the cold war and it's how we will win our new future struggles which may be many which may be complex but we will win if i become president first we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world events may require the use of military force but it's also a philosophical struggle like our long struggle in the cold war in this we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence attacks and everything else it is a dangerous world more dangerous now than it has ever been we should work thank you we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam but this has to be a two-way street they must also be good to us remember that they have to be good to us no longer one way it's now two way and remember us and all we are doing they have to appreciate what we've done to them we're gonna help but they have to appreciate what we've done for them this struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism for every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies we have no idea where these people are coming from there's no documentation there's no paperwork there's nothing we have to be smart we have to be vigilant a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next sanborn adeno or frankly much worse all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th one of the great catastrophes in my opinion the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country worse than pearl harbor because italian because you take a look at what's happened and citizens were attacked as opposed to the military being attacked one of the true great catastrophes and then there's isis i have a simple message for them their days are numbered i won't tell them where and i won't tell them how we must we must as a nation be more unpredictable we are totally predictable we tell everything with sending troops we tell them we're sending something else we have a news conference we have to be unpredictable and we have to be unpredictable starting now but they're going to be gone isis will be gone if i'm elected president and they'll be gone quickly they will be gone very very quickly secondly we have to rebuild our military and our economy the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded the military capability but look at what's happened to us our nuclear weapons arsenal our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal and it has to happen immediately are active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today the navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time the air force is about one third smaller than nineteen ninety one pilots flying b---fifty twos in combat missions today these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room and what are we doing about this president obama has proposed a tooth that 20,000 17 defense budget that in real dollars cuts nearly twenty-five percent from what we were spending in 2011 our military is depleted and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming we will spend what we need to rebuild our military it is the cheapest single investment we can make we will develop build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind our military dominance must be unquestioned and i mean unquestioned by anybody and everybody but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely in this time of mounting debt right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem but i do no one dollar can be wasted not one single dollar can we waste we're also going to have to change our trade immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again and to put americans first again this will ensure that our own workers right here in america get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues increase our economic might as a nation make us strong financially again so so important we need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority and nobody comes close gives us an edge this includes 3d printing artificial intelligence and cyber warfare a great country also takes care of its warriors our commitment to them is absolute and i mean absolute a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve and the best care in the world when they returned as veterans and they come back home to civilian life our veterans our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly these are our great people and we must treat them fairly and we must even treat them really really well and that will happen under the trump administration finally we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries look at what happened in the nineteen nineties our embassies in kenya and tanzania and this was a horrible period of time for us were attacked and 17 brave sailors were killed on the uss call and what did we do it seems we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization which has been a total disaster for the united states frankly we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn't do it and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon again the worst attack on our country in its history our foreign policy goals must be based on america's core national security interests and the following will be my priorities in the middle east our goals busby and i mean must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability not radical change we need to be clear cited about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies and believe me we have groups that no matter what you do they will be the enemy we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are who those people are and not help them and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends we desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china we have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes but we are not bound to be adversaries we should seek common ground based on shared interest russia for instance has also seen the hora of islamic terrorism i believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible absolutely possible common sense says this cycle this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon good for both countries some say the russians won't be reasonable i intend to find out if we can't make a deal under my administration a deal that's great not good great for america but also good for russia then we will quickly walk from the table it's as simple as that we're going to find out fixing our relations with china is another important step in really toward creating a even more prosperous period of time china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically which they are doing like never before we have lost all of their respect we have a massive trade deficit with china a deficit that we have to find a way quickly and i mean quickly to balance a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china better than we have right now look at what china is doing in the south china sea they're not supposed to be doing it no respect for this country for this president we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways if need be that's what's going to have to happen after i'm elected president i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies in these summits we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges for instance we will discuss how we can upgrade nato's outdated mission and structure grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges including migration and islamic terrorism i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative but if america fights it must only fight to win i will never send our finest into battle unless necessary and i mean absolutely necessary and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with the capital v our goal is peace and prosperity not war and destruction the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined deliberate and consistent foreign policy with president obama and secretary clinton we've had the exact opposite a reckless rudderless and aimless foreign policy one that is blaze the path of destruction in his wake after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars we are far worse shape in the middle east then ever ever ever before i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obama clinton it has been a complete and total disaster i will also be prepared to deploy america's economic resources financial leverage and sanctions can be very very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with total determination our power will be used if others do not play by the rules in other words if they do not treat us fairly our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand i will enforce that line in the sand believe me however unlike other candidates for the presidency warren aggression will not be my first instinct you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy a superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength although not in government service i was totally against the war in iraq very proudly saying for many years that would destabilize the middle east sadly i was correct and the biggest beneficiary has been iran who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their very very rich oil reserves something it has wanted to do for decades and now to top it off we have isis my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations that's why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about accept responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war we have to look to new people we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don't know what they're doing even though they may look awfully good writing in the new york times or being watched on television finally i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or once we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world then military interventions these are my goals as president i will seek a foreign policy that all americans whatever their party can support so important and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies that's what we want we want them to be our allies we want the world to be at we want to bring peace to the world too much destruction out there too many destructive weapons the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world to achieve these goals americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again many americans must wonder why are politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own americans americans must know that we're putting the american people first again on trade so true on trade on immigration on foreign policy the jobs incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priority no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we while being fair to them must start doing the same we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism the nation state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter and under my administration we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs nafta as an example has been a total disaster for the united states and has emptied our state's literally emptied our state's of our manufacturing and our jobs and i've just gotten to see it i've toured pennsylvania i've toward new york i've toured so many of the states they have been cleaned out their manufacturing is gone never again only the verse and i have to say this strongly never again only the reverse will happen we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later they fire the people they take advantage of the united states there will be consequences for those companies never again under a trump administration no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country i will view as president the world through the clear lands of american interests i will be america's greatest defender and most loyal champion we will not apologize for becoming successful again but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest america will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker we will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself but to play that role we must make america strong again and always always always we was make and we have to look at it from every angle and we have no choice we must make america respected again we must make america truly wealthy again and we were must we have to and we will make america great again and if we do that and if we do that perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever ever known thank you very much everybody appreciate it thank you thank you thank you yeah ok ladies and gentlemen please welcome the governor of the great state of new jersey - and thank you very much thank you very much great to be here in virginia thank you all for being here i it's an extraordinary troubling time for our country and the reason it's so troubling is that we have a nation that today feels more divided than any time in my lifetime and we r divided in large measure because our leaders are not providing the type of clarity about what are the important priorities that the people want our country to be pursuing the first and most important thing to me not only as a governor but more importantly as a husband and a father is the safety and the security of my family and i respect you feel the same way yeah and that safety and security is not just about being safe and secure from threats outside this country it's about making sure that we're safe and secure from threats of violence from within our country as well we need a president who once again we'll put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency in this country are police officers the men and women who stands each day to protect us need to understand that the president of the united states and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt not always believed that what they've done is somehow wrong we need to stand behind the men and women in blue in this country i spent seven years as a member of law enforcement the united states attorney in new jersey and during those years the president i served made it very clear to us that our first job was to protect the safety and security of the american people and that every other priority while important fell in behind that we need once again to have a president who puts the safety and security of our citizens first and does not blink or hesitate to take the strong action that needs to be taken to make sure that those both at home and around the world though that lawlessness will not be tolerated from anyone no matter how powerful or lack of power that those people may have one order needs to be the first priority once again in our in our country yeah and in this coming election there can be little question about where law and order stands and we're lawlessness stance the fact is that we have the spectacle last week of watching a director of the fbi twice in one week repeatedly say that the democratic nominee for president lied to the american people that the democratic nominee for president put her own political convenience ahead of the safety and security of the american people and fbi director who said that the repeated assurances that mrs. clinton has given us over the course of the last year regarding her email scandal in fact in every material way were false that's not a person who will stand for the rule of law that's a personal stand for the rule of her and that's not what we need the white house and everyone who's involved in law enforcement should be rightfully concerned if you have a president who puts the rule of law behind their own personal interests i support donald trump and have for quite some time because i know that he will be the type of president who will put the rule of law first we'll make sure that the laws enforced aggressively and appropriately and it will put people in his administration to understand that the rules in this country and the laws of this country apply to everyone not just the least power full but also the most powerful they applied everyone and so i am grateful and happy that you are here today to lend your voices to that effort it's also listen listen to what these candidates have to say listen how donald trump will stand up not only for those who serve today in law enforcement but also for the men and women who have served in our military they deserve much better than what this administration is given that we make that will mean making tough decisions that will mean breaking some china all throughout the government it will mean stopping it will mean stopping this pattern of accepting less than the best for the people of this country we need someone who has always demanded the best from everyone who has worked for him and with him and it will place the interest of the american people first and foremost that is the person who is going to be our republican nominee next week and is the person who i firmly believe will serve his country best as the next president united states we need to make sure that we go out there and fight as hard as we can to make that happen there will be no could have been should have ben's on the day after the election it's going to be we did it we fought for it we stood up and we took our country back to one order once again yeah the seven years i stood as us attorney i made sure that justice was both blind and fair and we need to make sure that that returns to our country it has left it in this administration and we need to restore it and that's why i'm so proud to be with the man that's here and you're going to hear from a few minutes today because he is someone who will make sure that he absolutely gives you the confidence every night when you put your head on the pillow that his number one priority will be the safety and security of your family thanks so much for being here today it's great to see all of ladies and gentlemen please welcome the chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs congressman jeff miller the great thing about a military town like virginia beach's that there are folks that understand what it means to take care of those that have worn the uniform of this nation unfortunately in recent years your government has not done the job that it's supposed to do for those who have served this nation it's not for a lack of money it's not for a lack of resources nor manpower the department of veterans affairs budget has quadrupled since 2001 they have almost 350,000 employees but the same department lurches back and forth every single day from scandal to scandal and veterans continue to pay the price what's missing is leadership at the top as a candidate barack obama promised veterans the moon as the president of the united states he has not delivered his department of veterans affairs has become a model of government dysfunction what's worse is he refuses to defend a law that he himself signed that would give the secretary of the department of veterans affairs the ability to fire those that have done veterans wrong yeah what america needs a commander-in-chief that understands the problem that faces the veterans of today and is committed to do and what it takes to solve the problems whatever it takes we won't get that from a career bureaucrat like hillary clinton who so who is so painfully out of touch with the veteran community that she thinks even though veterans 40 of them at least in phoenix waited on a waitlist and died she thinks that it's been over-exaggerated she can't solve the problems because she doesn't believe that there are any problems out there and if she ends up back in the white house which she won't but if she ended up back in the white house we would continue to see scandal after scandal within the department of veterans affairs but donald trump donald trump knows the challenges that face america's veterans today he has the experience and the leadership that is necessary to boldly reform the department of veterans affairs he's built a fantastic business one that's known all over the globe that's precisely the type of person that we need to boldly reform the department of veterans affairs and unlike hillary clinton donald trump doesn't view va's problems as a fantasy that's been created by the opposition party he knows that they're real and he has a plan to fix them and that's what we're going to hear about today ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to introduce to you the next president of the united states donald j what a great group thank you very much all i'd like to thank chairman jeff miller he's terrific guy and on behalf of all of those who have served this country in military uniform and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our truly great veterans thank you very much chef i appreciate it before going further today however i'd like to first address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform our police offices we love our police officers thank you that's very nice thank you police officers rush into danger every single day to protect our communities and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism they serve thousands of lives every year performed countless public services every day and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report but i want our nation's police to know that we thank you from the bottom of our heart and we support you and we will always always always stand with you the attack on our dallas police is an attack on our country our whole nation is in mourning and will be for a very long time yet we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty very big rice america's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos and the destruction of our country as we know it we must remember the police are needed the most where crime is the highest politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable americans it's time for a hostility against our police and against all members of law enforcement to end and end immediately right now we went through an ugly chapter in our history during vietnam when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas for too many police today that is their daily reality at the same time the tragic deaths in louisiana and minnesota make clear that the work must be done to ensure and a lot of work that americans feel that their safety is protected have to do it we have to get better better sharper smarter we were all disturbed by the images that we saw we must discuss as well the ongoing test raphy of crime in our inner cities our inner cities are rife with crime according to the chicago tribune there has already been more than 2,000 2,000 shooting victims in chicago alone this year this epidemic of violence destroys lives destroys communities and destroys opportunity for young americans violent crime has increased in cities across america the new york times described the startling rise and murders in our major cities brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into virginia and maryland too many americans are trapped in fear violence and poverty our inner cities have been left totally behind and i'm going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home a safe school and a safe community yeah we must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country one hundred percent we will cease to have a country hillary clinton on the other hand is weak and ineffective pandering and as proven by her recent email scandal which was an embarrassment not only to her but to the entire nation as a whole she's either a liar or grossly incompetent one of the other very simple personally it's probably both not only am i the law and order candidate but i'm also the candidate of compassion believe it the candidate of compassion but you can have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of our country every kid in america should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood without harm everyone will be protected equally and treated justly without prejudice we will be tough we will be smart we will be fair and we will protect all americans yeah without safety we have nothing it's the job of the next president to make america safe again for everyone everyone that promise of protection must include taking care of every last veteran which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the horrible attack in dallas the men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of america now is the time to follow their example of unity public service and selfless devotion to our nation we made a promise and we have to honor the promise that we made to these great heroes you defend america and america will defend thank you yeah but that promise has been broken by our politicians like so many other promises our country has made not only to its veterans but two its citizens as a whole president obama has allowed our veterans affairs health care all systems really denied them to help and the support and really has to do it we have to get on the ball we have to do it right hillary clinton recently said of the va scandal that it's not been as widespread as it's been made out to be that's a quote she actually thinks that the veterans health administration is well run that's because she's been part of this rig system for a long time perhaps it's easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they're being paid millions of dollars to read a teleprompter speeches to wall street executives instead of spending time with real people in real pain the disconnect yeah the disconnected america's deep there are two americas the ruling class and the groups of favors and then everyone else the va scandals that have occurred on this administration's watch are widespread and totally inexcusable an internal memo from the senior va officials describes quote lawlessness and chaos at the veterans health administration including the payments of six billion dollars a year in violation of federal contracting rules the memo also says they waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws and warns that these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to america's great veterans and you know it and you're singing even the white house his own deputy chiefs f described quote significant and chronic systemic failures in veterans affairs including a corrosive culture that has led to personal problems across the department with poor management and a history of retaliation against employees who raised issues and very good issues he said he said there is a lack of accountability across all grade levels on that he's correct 40 veterans just as an example have died waiting for karen phoenix 40 different va facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times a va employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff as was a convicted sex offender the va i spent eight million dollars on solar panels good old solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be tearing it down in the very near future the st. cloud minnesota va built a 2.3 million dollar wind turbine in april that hasn't supplied power since 2012 can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in january of 2017 yeah thank you thank you most of those responsible have still not been held to account fixing this corruption will be one of my many and really highest priorities and believe me it will happen i'm really good at things like that it will be fixed and that begins with a simple promise every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care every day veteran should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctrine clinics weather at a va facility or at a private medical center we must extend this right to all veterans not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from the va hospital which is unfortunately the current and wrong policy this promise includes guaranteed access to the best available health care services for our female veterans they're not being treated right we must also do more to help our veterans find jobs every year large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas and across the border to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our veterans veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect they fought hard to protect us they are going to come first in a trump administration they will be yeah they will be a part of america first it will be america first from now on america first yeah thank you thank you veteran's health care must also include the best mental health care a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day especially our older veterans this is a national tragedy that's not talked about the evidence shows that our veterans are in the system receiving care they are much less likely to take their own lives than veterans outside of this horrible horrible and very unfair system that is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the va while ensuring that veterans can access private mental health care as well have to do it have to do we have no choice america must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large this is for everyone this includes expanding the number of facilities integrating primary care and mental health care professionals reforming confinement rules very important and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones to the care and of the care they need especially in the many emergencies that were having all over the country and doing nothing whatsoever about it one of the most important reforms we can make his accountability right now when va employees fail our veterans you can't discipline them that's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform have to do it we like it we don't like it we have to do it it's time in fact employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions in 2014 the va awarded a 142 million dollars in bonuses to employees including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the denver va hospital that was more than 1 billion dollars over budget to other via executives signed abuse and they really abused it was terrible abuse their authority to obtain four hundred thousand dollars in relocation benefits currently a scandal and we're doing nothing about it doesn't have to be this way as veterans affair chairman jeff miller just said and will say all the time the va is not sacred the veteran is sacred the veteran is second connect here is my 10-step plan to ensure quality timely care for every single veteran in america one i will appoint a secretary of veterans affair who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the va and this will be a person of great competence this will not be a political hack the secretary soul mandate will be to serve our veterans are bureaucrats not politicians but veterans amazingly president obama's va secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at disneyland so what's wrong with that right - i'm going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail are veterans or breach the public trust 3 i'm going to ask congress to pass legislation that ensures the secretary of veterans affairs has the authority to remove your discipline any employee who risks the health safety or well-being of any veteran 4 i'm going to appoint a commission to investigate all of the wrongdoing at the va and then present those findings to congress as the basis for bold legislative reform 5 i'm going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the va have their jobs protected and are put in line for serious promotions if they continue to do great work i will create a private white house hotline that is really and so importantly going to be answered by a real person actually a person not a computer that picks up a phone call yeah and i don't take place 24 hours a day to ensure that no valid complaint about the va and it's wrongdoing falls through the cracks yeah i will instruct my staff that have a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me and i will pick up the phone and fix it myself if i have to believe thank you seven we are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money wasting money the bonuses the money that's being paid out and start giving bonuses to people for improving service saving lives and cutting waste if an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates really better outcomes for our veterans that a small responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to the taxpayers and it will be a lot we are going to reform our visa programs to ensure american veterans are in the front not the back of a line 9 we're going to increase the number of mental health care facilities and professionals and increase the outreach to veterans outside of the system of which there are many 10 we are going to ensure every veteran in america has the choice to seek care at the veterans administration or to seek private medical care paid for by our government never again will we allow a veteran to suffer a die waiting for care they so richly deserve these are our great people we need to clean out the corruption in government and hillary clinton will never be able to do it she's incompetent and has proven time and time again that she doesn't have what it takes doesn't have it yeah crooked hillary clinton yeah yeah sadly sadly crooked hillary clinton is the secretary of the status quo and wherever hillary clinton goes corruption and scandal follow just look at her life our country needs change and she will never give us change never ever ever the fact is she helped create are rigged system you saw that last week hillary clinton's america is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment so true and she couldn't care less despite what she says she couldn't care of its the rig system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of us everybody in this room everybody in this country at risk hillary clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and / pass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials what she did was so wrong what other people did far less and they're paying a tremendous price right now in other words she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading your emails as long as the voting american public could not her conduct was willful intentional and unlawful and to repeated false statements about her condom prove that she was fully aware of her guilt she knew it she's probably the most surprised person that she was able to get away with it this was not just extreme carelessness with classified material which is still totally disqualified this is calculated deliberate premeditated misconduct followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to congress the media and the american people in fact when the fbi interviewed her for only three hours during the fourth of july weekend her interview was not recorded and she was amazingly not even under oath you didn't know that she carried out her dangers email scheme at the same time as her bad judgment and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing isis all across the world afterwards as a further demonstration of guilt hillary clinton erased more than 30,000 emails as part of a cover-up general riesen part of a cover hard to believe what's going on with our country the fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment to me it is the greatest accomplishment yeah when thinking about our email destruction let's not forget many foreign and corporate entities and other special interests with business before hillary clinton state department were making massive financial contributions folks these contributions were made to both the clinton foundation and to the clintons directly if elected hillary clinton would become the first president of the united states who wouldn't be able to pass a background check she would not be able just look at what the fbi director said about her misconduct is a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country clearly hillary clinton think she's above the law come november the american people will show her that she is thank you ok the decades of decay division and decline will come to an end rapidly the years of america's greatness will return we are going to become for the first time in a long time one united country we're going to make america great again and safe again for all americans we will dream big and bold and daring things once more once more we're going to go big we're going to go great you can be so proud of your country let me conclude by paying tribute to every single american here who has served this country and most especially those who gave the ultimate thank you thank you our debt to them

to really serious talk do we want to stay out of the presidential race from their forward just let nature take its course whatever happens happens or did we want to do something that was gonna make a difference we've been friends with donald trump for fourteen years we know him well and i said to marry pad we never ever make a mistake by standing with your friend and donald trump is my friend so nearly so nearly three months ago he and i walked into a room together in fort worth texas shocked the world i announced my endorsement of him for president and they were all the skeptics and the critics at the time who criticized my decision well they can come in need the next president nineteen states with me and new jersey republicans are once again proving if you want the republican

months ago everybody just a little bit last six months till we change america by elected a new president getting rid of barack obama and hillary clinton i can tell you this i could say this is somebody's been on a few debate stage in my life that i know that hillary clinton's worst nightmare is going to be a climb onto that debate stage is september and look across at donald trump we we don't need more washingtondc insiders messing up this country and we sure as heck don't need hillary and bill clinton back in the white house we do not need the same type in effect of foreign policy that she brought his secretary of state we don't want america to be weak and disrespected we want america to be strong and respected and donald trump will make that happen and we certainly and we certainly don't want someone in the white house was gonna be more worried about being charged by her attorney general thereby protecting the people of this country we need a president we need a president who is going to put america first one more time to ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen you have waited more than enough on behalf of children on behalf of the republicans in new jersey the next president of the united his entire debt and give them a table that's terrible but he's a great guy and he's a great governor and i will tell you thank you i love you to look at these guys a little bit because he's been my friend long time he's done a great job and all that but i said let's be specific as we want to be specific so i said give me some information and i but i look forward to debating hillary will look at so i said let's be specific so you know governor christy your governor balance the budget six times without raising taxes not easy to enacted a 2.3 billion dollar job-creating tax cuts and that's a lot of stuff 2.3 billion not easy and i can tell you he's shrek 2 state government by 6,500 jobs governor christy listen to this one bipartisan this is bipartisan and what's a beautiful thing actually economic opportunity act will ultimately create 27,000 jobs 23 2010 the construction industry lot of my friends here tonight we're all in the construction industry governor christie contributed more to the pension system than any other governor in new jersey state governor christie brought the insolvent and this was important insolvent new jersey unemployment insurance trust run back to solvency and i will tell you it was done in at least two years ahead of schedule so that's a pretty good track record and that's just a few of the things alright that's just a few so we've had it says take time and you know it all started at chris was out there and i was out there and i have to say one of the more interesting parts was i was watching the debate because i had one debate that i really enjoyed as i was watching and i like marco very much but marco is over here chris was over here and i was standing and i watched it happen no i watched it happen and it was i mean he look like perry mason that it was and marco will admit that was a rough rough evening so this his death is nothing like wise guys so june 7 do me a favor go out and vote place and boy were gonna go out in november that i dunno but go out on june june 7th on june sixteenth we're gonna build that wall to wall is gonna be but we want the wall you know hillary you talk about bernie sanders burning i love this is that hillary really isn't essentially not fit to be president she's not qualified to be president you know why he said because she suffers from bad judgment so today she made this she won't use the term radical islamic terrorism you understand you know why she won't because her president won't use it that's why and by the way is she being nice to him you know she's to be terrible she couldn't stand him in the husband couldn't stand still couldn't stand him and she couldn't stand him i wonder why she's being so nice can you figure it out beso nice she didn't like your blood little bit now anything he said by presidents by president said but if you think about it and if you look at it he said unqualified and he said that she suffers from bad judgment and she does so today we had a terrible tragedy and she came up and she said that donald trump talked about radical islamic terrorism which he doesn't want to use used a different because she doesn't want to use that she refuses to use that and i'm setting myself and it's a terrible thing and he essentially shouldn't be running for office he doesn't have the right to run for office and i'm setting myself what just happened about twelve hours ago plane got blown out of the sky i don't think anybody thinks it wasn't blown out of the sky you are 100% wrong folks ok here 100% and it's getting worse and you know too that was watching one of the networks and that is great guy from the fbi on what he was talking about what happened with the plane was like amazing and i didn't know i never met him i never saw him before on television and he's going back and forth about how bad it is and how bad it's getting and how we're losing control and how we don't have a president that knows what he's doing and then at the end you should let me just tell you something i don't know this man he said the person that knows what's going on the person that understands what's happening is a guy named donald trump exactly this terrorism and that really so on june 16 i came down that escalated a beautiful escalator and jumped our trump tower this is very nice and it was a big day and i just said we have to do it this show many things that we can do to make america great again and when am i gonna do and if hillary clinton gets in i don't know of our country could never recover you know yesterday i named a large number of judges and i'll be adding to that number who are really highly highly respected judges they come out of heritage they come out of different groups have recommended very very strongly they've really recommended strong lady said rape charges will be adding some additional ones chris and its outstanding one of the most important things always security for us right away security but one of the most important things will be doing whoever the next president's is naming judges now it's probably naming the justices of the united states supreme court because they're gonna take us to the certain direction it's either going to be down the tubes or its gonna be through i'll tell you through the roof and the judges the justices and some of them are currently judges i guess almost all of the currently judges but the justices of the united states supreme court the next three it'll be three it could be five by the way probably going to be three most likely 34 and it could even be five that is a massive number of justices who will show whoever wins and it looks like it's going to be hillary because it looks me what's happening she's got totally embroiled in this you talk about bad judgment how bad a judgment is the emails can how did so what reason did you do that now i know the reason i know the reason and it's always the same with her and it's always the same with them but i know she's allowed argues that one already feel like i can go cricket hillary it may be more accurate but she's probably going to get out because they keep letting her what she is done is so much worse than what anybody else running ever ever has done what anybody as you look at all these people general petraeus you look at these people they've done a tiny fraction of what she's done and their lives have been destroyed their lives had been ruined what she has done what she has done for her to be able to continue to run is an absolute disgrace in my opinion to this country i just stress every time i turn it on and watch the race bernie sanders wins bernie sanders where he keeps winning and then they have the roundtable well i hillary clinton will win i'd like it's a rig is a regular you notice the way i started talking to using the word rick right about four months ago nobody used to a drink now everybody's going to rig a copy my i wanna go out i want to have that phrase going but i use the word rigs for five months ago the republican deal was raked a hundred percent now what did i do you had to win by massive numbers and boy did we get massive numbers week you know i had by far the most elegance and i came into new york and everybody said well new york and the people they know me it's nice when the people and you know me as well as a no me live in your nominee employees right now i have many people have so many employees in new jersey i hate to think about it i have to be honest ok i am taking care of more education and more salaries and more health care than anybody probably kristen almost anybody in new jersey right but honestly i'm happy to do it i'm happy we have great people new jersey new jersey is a great state it's a state where we have truly truly great people truly great so i came to new york and we didn't win by little bit we won in a massive landslide we want everything and the nice part is they know me the best unit supposing you go into a community and they know you and you don't do well that's not a good sign they know me so well they have seen me for so many years they're probably sick of me but they said

every state and we want every saved by massive numbers and don't forget i got 66 and 67 percent don't forget have three people running when these guys on television the most designers human bc's vaporizer look at all the couch i watch krauthammer we had like seven or eight people nine people running ok donald trump did not get fifty percent 50% sometimes i have seventeen people and actually after about two or three weeks i won new hampshire which was amazing we gonna take care of those people in new hampshire they have a drug problem that you wouldn't believe they have heroin pouring over the border within a seal of that border we're going to build a wall we're going to have real protection believe we're gonna do it for everybody but we're really doing it the people of new hampshire are i mean it's incredible it's incredible what happen what happened is and what's happening here in new jersey the drugs have pouring across illegal immigration illegal immigrants we are going to stop it we're gonna build that wall it's gonna be a real wall and we're gonna have people come into our country but they're going to come into our country legally ok so i went through the next week i win new york in a landslide i win then i win the five states and then i'm watching and i'm hearing that i got you know something a little bit less than actually every one of his own but i should have done better and i say white devil these people and then i go to indiana that was going to be the firewall and i went there and we won indiana so big and everybody just you know if they did chris knows they gave up they gave up that was the end and we had a little help it was amended bobby knight ok bobbie will be and we had loophole to we had bigger and we had a lot of people we had a great coach from purdue we had a lot of great people that really support it but when bobby knight 1 900 games three championships he had the last undefeated team in basketball in college basketball which is a helluva statement said two undefeated teams he had won the year before which lost one game but he was a great coach loved and is a great coach he looks better than ever but he came out for trump and i want to tell you that state went crazy so that was good and there was ever an endorsement that was good we won indiana and a landslide everyone gave up and now we're going through and we're doing great and we're just about fifty 50 short and we're gonna do have an amazing convention and why did it take care of trade we're gonna make great trade deals were gonna stop with this done says we are going to make great trade deals you know with china we have a trade deficit with china five hundred and five billion dollars a year think of how how stupid obama does nothing about it hillary knows nothing about it she is absolutely no idea and she's taken care of by all the people that are putting up for money anyway she's taken so even if she did she wouldn't know what to do patricia said i can't do that i can't hurt these people they gave me millions of dollars let me just tell you we are going to make the great trade deals out of absolute disgusting the worst ever negotiated by any country ever in the world that's how bad they are taking our jobs they're taking on money that taking everything i really i'll tell you what to be the most interesting was cos i love new york i know new york but i actually really towards the state like i'd ever did before i went up to albany and i went up to syracuse and i went up to rome that's real new york that's the real wrong right i went up to roman i went out to the island to bethpage in suffolk john laval and joe and all these guys and and we just so great but i looked at factories and i looked at buildings that were absolutely terrible to look at they were crumbling and you could see twenty years ago twenty five years ago you could see vibrance and today you could buy it for $2 i mean i looked at places and then i went to pennsylvania and i looked at places and by the way in pennsylvania a week before we have hillary saying that she's gonna put the miners and the coal mines out of business and i said when i want new yorkers interesting i said we're gonna put the miners back to work i don't even know why i said it in a few weeks later i went to west virginia you want to see good numbers i really had good numbers in west virginia and i didn't say that reason but we're going to put people back to work with you to take jobs back and wait to use our power including our power of taxation when a company moves to mexico and they think they're gonna drop out like carrier like for like nabisco they think they're going to take our people fire all of our people most of mexico make their air conditioners and sell them right across the border no tax no nothing just what folks not work that way now i'm a free trader but i'm only a free-trader we make good deals you can't be a free-trader if everybody else you know these very conservative ideologues issue will donald trump is not a free-trader that jeb bush donald trump is not a conservative i am sorry but who cares so somebody has vs today tell me well are you ever free trade but his is a story you wanted to find actually with sean hannity last night trade nice guy right to it here's my trade by trade deal here's a day said what about it i said here's what we're going to do my trade deal is very simple here's what it is i am going to make great deals for a country that's gonna make great use for our country you can talk free trade you control it fifteen you can do whatever you want to call it we're going to make great deals for a cut you might be free might not be free i can tell you this went carrier and ford and nabisco leaving chicago with a big plan to move into mexico i'm not eating oreos animal you know that you're not eating areas know mario castel feel bad for either but i'll tell you there's gotta be consequences when they moved there's gotta be consequences now i've watched for six years as the united states government on a federal basis united states government worked very hard on documents to loan money to companies they want to give them low-interest loans you know some companies actually took the money and then we'll have made these agreements but they wanna they want to come up with ideas so here's my idea to set an idea so simple and they worked on it for six years in the meantime you look at new york you look at new jersey by the way you looked at different parts of this country what nasa has done to us signed by bill clinton by the way by bill clinton it's the worst trade deal in my opinion into history certainly in the history of this country one of the worst ever and it's gonna be repealed believe it's going to be changed its going to be repealed or totally renegotiated probably revealed probably repealed probably so here's what we're doing cell carrier is right i would say hi kerry how you do it i gotta make the call myself chris am i aloud as president of the united states am i allowed to call the president of an air conditioning company may i he said only one time it'll only take one is my wife would say don't do that you're the president but it's so much fun song called ahead of jerry and sport and these others and i said let me just tell you something you've let go of thousands of people and you've left in this case indiana and chicago and all of the different places right and michigan which i'm gonna win michigan went on to win illinois we're gonna win indiana we're going to win these things because i've been talking about it for years these other guys they start talking about it and believe music into work for them not gonna work out so well but we're gonna win michigan big you watch what happens but i'm good to say to him you want to move your plan enjoy mexico a wonderful place beautiful weather i hope you like two hundred and twenty degrees it's wonderful but he has like you going to do every unit you make that you sell it to the united states you get a pay a 35 percent tax ok now now some conservatives would say that's not free market i mean we're losing our share trucks were losing our jobs we don't have a choice so he's gonna do if i saw carrier before they move otherwise i want to get into quickly because i'm going to call them fans have a move yet but before they move you move enjoy yourself 35% tax they're not moving very simple looking that if it's too late they move i'm charging some but i'm charging these companies subtext because you know what we're getting killed were losing jobs losing everything at least the united states is gonna make a hell of a lot of money and what do you think these dummies say oh well that's a trade war trade war will losing five hundred billion in trade with china who the hell cares of this trademark it's crazy 500 billion and they tell me about a trade war and you have a trade with two things are going to happen china devalue the currency that's how they're killing us okay they devalue their currency they're behaving very very badly and on top of that building fortresses in the south china sea and let me tell you something china will behave and china will be our friend will do better with china under me and we can also do better economically with me to respect our country again i was sold just yesterday by a very important person that china is very concerned about donald trump being elected because you know i have to pay up to get out to do something they're gonna china is killing us countries with devaluation of the currency and then make it impossible for our companies to compete and they doing it more than ever and worse than ever about nine months ago they did a devaluation that they weren't supposed to do it was the biggest devaluation in 20 years ok the biggest devaluation in two decades not gonna happen anymore folks they make it impossible for us it's not gonna happen anymore and went companies different situation and they want to move to a different place where they want to move in particular to mexico which is becoming a mini version of china friendly with mexico and i love the mexican people employ thousands and thousands of hispanics and i'm doing great in the polls and by the way the hispanics love me you know why they illegally that hispanics are here legally they don't want two houses away they don't want their job second away that's why i'm doing well with hispanics now that we're doing great with the african-americans because they know i'm gonna create jobs i'm gonna bring back jobs we are not going to be this stupid country anymore we're right now folks believe me we are viewed as this stupid country will like a big big sloppy bully that gets punched in the face it goes down yet fully get knocked out it's it's a terrible thing unless you doing the punching that it's ok ok but just so you understand whether to change things ok so we're gonna make great trade deals we're gonna have tremendous borders and we want people to come in to come in legally we're gonna have the wall we need the wall for the drugs just recently two weeks ago 16,500 border patrol agents endorsement and i call them and i said to him cranks and crazies are great people they are told to stand back these are great people they say what they want to do the job they're fantastic people and they could do a great job but i said to him when they endorse it have to issue in question do we need the wall you know there is absolutely need to you have to tell me who knows better than what they do they want the border they said mr. trump you absolutely it's another tool and there are other things but you absolutely have to have the warmest a truck but it's gotta be a real one not a little toy will see that ceiling that's ok thats telugu we are going to build a wall and get up get down for this law and we're gonna make it beautiful and we're gonna make it big and we're gonna make it powerful rebuild our military because our military's being decimated did anybody see the big keisha was on television all last week where r fighter jets are going to jump to abide by this is our fight this is the united states right they sought where r fighter pilots and fighter planes they going to junk yards where they have the jump judge for the old broken-down plans and as stripping in a plane departs at putting them on our 20 year old fighter planes and well i custard world country and what we do is change and other countries are ordering planes that a modern playing beautiful and we got stuff we're putting jumped back on our plans and we're putting our pilots and their and they're taking planes and there's stripping other planes that are on the runway because they can't get the planes to work so they using essentially 60% and i'm saying is this the united states is this country so we're going obama doesn't care the jet care check sooo whether i did you our military is being depleted at a time when we need a military probably more than ever before right we are going to have a military that's going to be so big and so strong and so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us just remember and to me very important we are going to take care of our vets because that's our big treated that way we're going to repeal and replace obamacare obamacare is we're going to germinate comment or and we're going to have a local education for your children we're going to preserve the second amendment which is under siege and we are going to make america stress you know there's an expression we don't make america that's why we have all these bad deals we have these negotiate is traceable their political hacks they shouldn't have the job with it to use our great we have the greatest business people in the world with it he used the greatest business minds will we negotiate with china and haulage countries that rip us off we could use the greatest business people in the world you're gonna see a difference like you've never seen before and when we defend all these countries in nato we are nato but you know what we have a lot of the countries in nato they're not paying us is supposed to be paying us they're not living up to you know in the old days when i used to collect rent in brooklyn which say i'd say the word is delinquent ok they owe us money delinquent so we gotta pay so we're just sending them a fraction of what they're supposed to do you know the kind of money which i can about now we defend japan bus people don't even know if we defend japan germany we defend saudi arabia saudi arabia before the oil price drop in oil and that don't worry about it they're making a lot they were making one billion dollars a day would you like that for new jersey chris a billion we had practically nothing and they wouldn't be there and i have so many friends disorders that by my apartment you wouldn't believe it ok if we cannot be ruled that a longer we cannot be taken advantage of any longer we are going to make our country rich again and strong again we're going to be able to afford social security and medicare again when i get to be let down the tubes by an incompetent person like hillary clinton because you look at what she's done you look at what she's done you look at her deal with libya just take a look at libya it is a catastrophe by the way you had the big guys think of what libya you know they have some of the finest oil in the world you know it's got the oil prices has the oil i says this was her deal and so many other mistakes so many other mistakes and have a whole list i'm not gonna do that cuz we having too much fun i've got all over the country i've seen millions of people at my events if you had him up millions we have the biggest crowds by far far bigger than burning far bigger than anybody we have the biggest crowds he is second and i think what happens i believe that his people a large percentage of his people vote for trump you watch because the one thing he's right on trend i mean he's got that right except he can't do anything about it we both have the same view we're getting ripped off and read the difference is i'm gonna make them great deals as opposed to just saying we're getting ripped off that's all it can do so here is what we do we're gonna make our country absolutely great again we're gonna start winning we don't win anymore we don't want any more within a win on a military we're gonna win for events we gonna win on health care on common core with terminating we're gonna win with our education we're gonna win it every single level we're gonna win with that trade we're gonna win with the border and we're gonna wind so much you guys were all friends right chris christie call me maybe mary pat would even be better cuz i think maybe she'd be better and you gotta say donald the people of new jersey can not stand you winning so much for our country they can't stand it could you stop learning so much it's driving them crazy and i'm gonna say mary pat i won't do that we are going to win win win we are going to make america great again greater than ever before and burns and the right side broadcasting network the trucks trains number one source for all things drop keep in contact with donald trump watching the right side broadcast network learning all you can about the number one candidate to become president of the united states donald j truck subscribe and stay connected and learn all things from i watched the right side at jamil shot that you're listening to right side broadcasting network because the rights is the race is to network ah it was amazing thank you were saying yeah yeah yeah well i want to thank this is incredible you know i had a press conference before one of the questions was mr. trump what are you doing you're not supposed to be campaigning today you've broken all the rules what's going on they're having their convention sure you're not supposed to be campaigning well guess what folks with because we're going to make america great again folks we're going to make america great again remember that and they said the same thing you know during the primers with 17 people very talented people and they said the same thing this will never work because trump comes in he has these big rallies and that he leaves and i'm supposed to have dinner like with two people spend the entire evening they go to another tip and they said well why do you do that i said well i do it because i can get the rallies the other people can't get the rallies space but that work i have to thank to people that have been fun believable and great friends tom marino congressman where's tom get up here top get up here at lou barletta get up your dairy whoo blue right they have like big fences to create just a that just really like talking we all know what you look like here now but they have been so great right from the beginning and i want to thank i want to thank you both i want to thank you both i mean so it's been an amazing a sit-down come on we've got plenty of time right we have nothing but time is a nice place this is very nice first of all mike pence has been amazing and you know one of the reasons and this is a hundred percent one of the reasons i chose mike was because indiana under his leadership has done so well it's done so incredibly triple a bond rating they have really low unemployment one of the top few states everything is good even for the veterans in terms of employment i think it was 32 38 no that's not a good number that was when he got into office and when he left right now basically they were number two in the nation he wants it to be number one that's incredible that's veterans being employed by some of the folks in this room so that was now when we won new york you know we had these incredible victories and what do i know about politics huh what away but we do have a lot of common sense all of us that way we know we know we know a lot right now when i had these i had a run that was incredible it started with new york and new york and you know what's nice i won new york queen squeeze your right please he knows what are you doing here what are you doing it but we had this incredible period of time we can we just kept winning winning winning but i went to new york and we had a massive landslide victory won just about everything and in my victory speech i don't even know why i said but is it and we're going this is in the middle of fifth avenue ok we're going to put the miners back to work i said that i don't even know and by the way that includes the steelworkers and we're going to take a lot of the regulations off of gas because gas is big and they want to close you down they want to close the mines that they've been closing mines down it said it said but little did i realize that shortly thereafter go to a place called west virginia and did they love truck did you see those numbers and hillary clinton crooked hillary clinton she's really cooking so hillary clinton yeah yeah i haha yeah haha you know what we're going to do even better we're going to beat her or november eight we're gonna beat her ok that's even better ok as well we're gonna go gotta get out there we got a boat you gotta get out there we got to get out there but you remember so hilary gave a press conference in an area where coal and the different things that we all love wasn't so important right and she figures you make the statement and it wouldn't get back to west virginia it got back to west virginia and it got back to pennsylvania and it got back to ohio and it got back to a lot of places that she didn't want to hear that message she said we're going to put the coal miners and we're going to put the coal mines at a business okay no good and we had an event it was it a big massive place it was beautiful in west virginia and the place was packed had to be ten twelve thousand people and outside they had at least double that number and it was love and i went and saw some of the miners and i said so tell me we have to think of like leaving and going to another place and maybe doing something else instead of this they said mr. trump and i understand it so well we love mining we love doing it this is our livelihood our fathers are grand for this is what we do we do it so well we don't want to do something else and i said i love that i love that i can understand it and i love that so hang in because we're going to put you back to work we're going to put you back it's going to be a beautiful thing to see because he's a great people these are amazing people and so many from this area but somebody from the state and i went to school in pennsylvania i'll of pennsylvania well i'll of pennsylvania and we're just going to you know when i look at i look around and i see what happened i didn't need to do this i had a very nice life beautiful family a beautiful business i built this incredible company all good and i just couldn't stand by you look at the iran deal you look at so many diff everything is wrong everything is wrong take a look i'll tell you what let's talk take a look at the convention that's going on right now they don't honor think of it they don't honor our police they don't honor a law awesome we started complaining they had no american flags on this massive states they had no american flag they forgot they forgot to put up now we had a lot of flats yeah somebody said i can't see you mr. truck there too many flags i said that's okay we'll leave it that way but we had a tremendous success and we got a balance that according to one of the networks that it was one of the biggest bounces that anyone seen now i give a lot of credit for that to my family my family milania and tiffany and ivanka and don and eric and they talk about these people they start starts i'd rather have those five stars much more so those five plus 1 by the way but they did an amazing job and i have one of the stars with me show you introduce you to eric eric eric wow look at this crowd amazing well you know what guys i had to come today i spent so much of my youth in screaming in carbondale and waverly so many of my best friends in the world i went to boarding school in pennsylvania for five years and i just love the state but i know this area as well as anyone and i just had to be here today we have so many great friends here thank you and you know we just came off a convention and we had the greatest time it was such an honor to be up there to talk about my father and we had the greatest greatest time we are so proud of him and we are going to make america great again we're going to win this in november and we are going to make this country great again thank you very much guys yeah that's by six foot six boy he's a good guy he's a good guy he loves this area he really did he loved he loved to school you went to he went to the hill school and he loved it and yet he did well he did well he's been doing well i'm very proud of my children thank you thank you very much i'm very proud of my children so president obama today was interviewed on a shop i mean look honestly if he did a great job as president i don't care he's a democrat republican conservative liberal i don't care if he did a great job as president i would be so happy and so with you i would be so happy it hasn't worked out that way ok it hasn't worked out that way we're scuffed at all over the world will look down upon all over the world would not respect it anymore we were talking about putin today no respect no like no nothing you know wouldn't be a great thing if we could actually get along with russia would not be a good thing ok quickly not a bad thing it would be a good thing would be a good thing if we could make deals trade deals with china that instead of losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year and rebuilding china the roadways the airport you have to see the tunnels that we did much better than we're doing right now and you know i'm a free trader i'm a free trader i believe in it but you need smart people to make great deals we don't have the right people we are being ripped off by every single country we do business with or drain every single country we do business with we have people negotiating our deals that are political hacks and these are deals that are specific you know you could take a mid-sized country and the trade deals are bigger than these massive deals you read about with corporation generally so massive deals these are big deals there is no bigger deal than our deals with china on trade but it's a one-way street they take their product they flow it in and by the way for you still work as they dumped more steel of this place because they're going to put you out of business you're already mostly out of business but they want to put you out of business whether it is start making things again folks we're going to start making things again that includes steel but we're going to start making things again a friend of mine is a manufacturer is a great manufacturing and he's not a very political person which is probably good for him but he's a great manufacture and he calls me up and he goes you know it's really said i worked so hard to get into chennai can't break in he can't get in it's so hard then he finally gets in and he has to pay mess of taxes on everything and they want to open up plants in china we're not going to let you do the setting board and i'm not even blaming china i think is doing the right thing for them but they're killing us that killing us and it's not going to happen anymore fault not going to and the problem is it's a one-way street we pay tax they don't take our goods they make us build like crazy over there you look at boeing they order 300 plans they end up having to build a massive place over there they devalue their currency their grand grand masters of the greatest in the world ever japan's good they're oakland when we don't know what's happening and it's so easy to stop because they send their goods in and they send him in without tax and that can happen so he's history here's the story i won the state of indiana where i got to know mike pence and one of the reasons i want well maybe the biggest reason was bobby knight came out and he said you know we want drop right look at her we want trump but bobby knight was so great but one of the big reasons i won indiana was because carrier condition and announced actually about a year before but i kept talking about carrier carry i didn't know i did you know it was going to be good for me it turned out to be good from because every time i made a speech in indiana i have so many of these 1,400 people that got laid off they were carrying four years something for 3035 years good people and one day and if i didn't have two cell phones all those cell phones where they take the pictures they had was all over the news somebody was taking a picture of this sort of mid-level managers saying listen now we're going to fire everybody and we're moving to mexico just another case but you know what it's much more effective when you can see it let's say that same thing happened but we didn't have the picture of these people that would devastate their devastating this has been the job for many years and it's a good job you know the jobs we have are good jobs anymore their jobs and even the opponents say they're bad jobs so i go to indiana and i've been talking about carrier for a long time and it got worse and worse and many other cut this is just in all fairness to carry this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of companies that are moving out in this case going to mexico many of them go to mexico but in this case going to mix so they announced the closing the fire everybody they're going to go to mexico they're going to make their conditions are going to sell them over here and that's it not anymore folks not anymore not anymore so now when that happens and this can pertain to all of your going to keep your company's i'm going to bring a lot of companies back with a pretty good job back we're going to bring our callback and we're going to clean call it sleep call we're gonna go and that guess is going to be just a beautiful thing okay because they want to regulate your right out of business they want you out they want to stop that one now so what happens is this they think they're going to go make their products sell it and everyone is going to be happy so for years i've been watching even before this administration this beauty of an administration i've been watching and i've seen they're always trying to stop people from what they're trying to come up with plans may be low interest loans may be zero interest loans i think they made a couple where they actually had the people they gave him the money and zero interest or whatever and then they move because they forgot to say you can't believe we're giving your money this is the people we so here's the story is this does very simple i'm a free trader but when trade isn't fair and when things aren't fair and when countries disrespect us we're going to be very firm very nice i get along great with leadership and i don't again i don't i'm not angry the leadership of mexico or japan or vietnam new strong vietnam or china i respect what you're doing what they've done is fantastic for them for us horrible so what we do is very simple i've watched for so many years and it's so basic half of the people and i know a few of the people here the great business people friends of my dear friends of mine they came there's one right over here stand up albert where the hell are you over stand up albert he's a good golfer but i'm actually a better golfer than him right okay but i have a lot of friends in the room great friends but here's what we're going to do they're gonna make their product now here's what they want to do you want to make their products ended in sell the product in indiana and every other place like nothing happened there's gonna be consequences so we tell them now if you get to them early enough before they build their plant you say listen we're really happy that you're moving to mexico we think it's wonderful very hot but we think it's wonderful but here's the story if you're going to move to mexico every single time you make an air conditioning unit we're going to charge you a thirty-five percent tax everything yeah we're not going to give you money we're not gonna loan you money that you don't need this kind but they don't need money to get plenty of money this has nothing to do with loans this has nothing to do with anything so all these incentives that our government which is complicated you know loaning money giving money and doing tax abatements very simple and i guarantee you and i always joke i it's so much fun to me and i'll of business i just love it and evidence take for that mean i built an unbelievable company like a great some of the greatest assets of the world some of the greatest assets in the world like incredible and i like it the only promises president i probably shouldn't be making the call right i can talk about this but - i shouldn't be calling the head of an air conditioning company right to do it so easy like three minutes my wife would say you shouldn't be calling the head of carrier air conditioning i say but honey i just i'm telling you it's so easy because i have some of the greatest business leaders in the world endorse me carl icahn great great business leader so many others and the reason is because they know i know what i'm doing so what happens is this i got a call okay the worst i'll have one of my killers call all right one of the people that you wouldn't like very much but who cares you wouldn't want him out for dinner some are actually nice but most are rather ruthless and vicious but that's what i want negotiating i don't want our political hacks negotiating right i want these guys so but a few i have to do myself because it's fun so we call and he'll go yes mr. president great honor to talk to a great honor to talk to you also listen you're moving i am saying you're leaving you going from indiana to mexico right yes well i hope you change your mind well sir we want now you have to understand i will be hit by every lobbyist and every special interest group in america in order to not make the call in order to let the deal die like hillary rodham clinton hillary rodham clinton so crooked hillary so selleck here's the story so normally a politician so they're going to be calling going to call in the talk and they'll say you know this and that and they'll say madam president of you i don't want to hear them i do want to hear it eventually because i want to see a woman become president but it can't be her she's a disaster she's a disaster she'll set you back a long way women of that happens it will be a long way before it happens again you better be careful what you wish for so here's the story they say to hillary that say you can't do that they gave you two million dollars or you can't do that your lobbyist paid you a fortune and raised millions of dollars for you especially should go you're right i can't really do that that's the end of it okay that's and so they moved to mexico they will sell their goods we have our 1400 people unemployed and i'm talking about times thousands times thousands of jobs and millions of jobs millions of jobs now here's the difference me they call i don't care who is it i know half of these guys anyway i don't care what do i want to take his call for ok does nothing for me you know i spent 60 million dollars so far in my campaign right 60 and i'm spending last week last month i guess it was somebody said i thought it was two million and they said it was 3.8 million it's really good when you don't know that it's three pointing right now i thought i put up to is a matching something and i de soto would you put up two million was actually 3.8 million and i said to myself you know it's great when you can put up three point eight million sort of two million you don't care the way this i don't care i don't and i'm continuing but i'm raising a lot of money we're raising a lot of money for the republican party and it's coming in big league and it's coming in small doses and that's something no other republicans going to be able to do mike pence was just saying it's an amazing thing we raised like 27 million dollars for a partial month less what they were doing equally well this month of and i think the average price was the average cost was like 61 or $64 something like that and that doesn't happen that happens for bernie sanders because it's a different kind of mentality and thinking and by the way poor bernie for he just wants to go home and go to sleep please now he wants to go to sleep who can blame him who can blend who can blame him he wants to go home he did you see left very early last night he's exhausted but we're going to get the bernie people a lot of them lot more than people think because i know the trade he was right about one thing trade he said we're being screwed on trade and he's right he's right yeah what's happening with trade is right i will talk about it a little bit we're going to talk about the border we're going to talk about are depleted marilyn you know little things but look burning really hurt his legacy because if he would have gone all the way and if they would have had some kind of a march and then he goes and he goes back to being said i think it's a lot better than the way he sold out to hillary clinton who sold on the show that i mean other than trade and the problem is he knows trades no good the differences i'll do something about it big league because i like the trade but we're going to make great deals somebody said to me well you're free traders yeah are you a fair trade in here i'm everything i could name ten different forms of trade i know every one of them ate the wharton school of finance right here in this great state right but but the best school festival number one vessel ok so so here's the story so i can name all of them so one of these characters back here look at all of them you know for for a group of people that said why you campaigning what do we have a lot of people back there you know what for a group of people that asked me this morning sir this isn't traditional that you would be out of the stop whi you campaigning man a hell of a lot of people showed up for this didn't they look at i'm believe it i believe it yeah is that unbelievable by the way i have to tell you they are the most dishonest human beings 11 i really move the mouth the most dishonest human being to true especially if you're like a republican or conservative it forget it forget it these are really bad people at twenty-five percent of rumor fine fifty percent are not great and twenty-five percent are among the worst people you will ever encounter in your life its stroke they live they live they like you know the story where they never showed the size of the crowds i never do it they never do it unless the protein you know i don't have protesters people are so in love i always say the safest place you can be is that a trump rally the safest part the safest drill true yeah so so we're going to bring it all back it's going to all come back it's going to come back bigger and better than you've ever seen it before you can have jobs flowing in believe me you're going to have the carriers of the world so i think i'm not going to leave because now we're playing with a different kind of mentality they're not going to leave because they going to say we're not leaving now they want to go to another state or there that's different you got to all sort of negotiate with each other good luck folks good luck our congressman good luck but you know when they start leaving our country for another country because with the stupid people that's not going to happen okay that's just not going to happen so if you look at what's going on right now in a place that so far away a place that i happen to love world philadelphia i love it you've got people that are fighting and trying to make the point and they don't know what's happening because remember when i ran and everybody said well trump won beat like all of these people all these professional politicians of normal and some very good people like ben carson is grady endorsement great people but very capable people and i wrote it down to have these signs ok they haven't mentioned isis they don't want to mention white because they created it so they don't mention isis i told you before they don't mention our police or our law enforcement and they wouldn't have those doors open for two minutes if it weren't for the police they would have a moment for human right their new name which is the joke of all time is that crooked hillary is a changemaker juicy changement you know they probably paid two million dollars for the guy came up with that slogan and i came up with crooked hillary all by myself zero no mine but changemaker she change her so she's been doing this for like 30 years plus and she's going to be a change maker right she's not going to change because the special interest in her lobbyists will never ever ever let her change believe me they will never let her change even if you want to do and she doesn't want to okay look at tpp so tpp trans-pacific partnership right a horrible deal that she was totally in favor she said it was the gold standard not long ago it's the gold standard of trade deal will remember this the worst deal ever sign from an economic standpoint in the history of our country right nafta signed by ho bill clinton who by the way gave a speech last night but he didn't mention my favorite chapter he left one chapter out huh i mean i met a girl i met a girl you know it's funny when he started the speech last night he said i met a girl and i said that's politically incorrect what is and i saw a rachel maddow give him hell over that it's not girl but he said i met a girl a lot of people thought that was nice but i said watch and rachel maddow knocked the hell out of them because he said he met a girl because it's supposed to be i met a woman i met a woman i don't know maybe we'll fight for him and that one right and then he say i then grabbed her and i said boy this is getting a little crazy now what's going on right i grabbed i grabbed her and then when he said that i knew that my favorite chapter would happen and it didn't happen he didn't talk about the kinds of things we want to hear about so what are you gonna do but he's in there pitching right he's in their pension so look here's the story they call her a changemaker should not a change mecca she's not a chance she wants to keep it just the way it is because it's a rigged system she was very very disloyal now the last person that i like is debbie wasserman chills this person is a disaster and she has been for a long time we'll take our rights previous any day right well tech rights is a great guy and he's done a great job and we had a great great convention and i'll tell you what i cleveland did a fantastic job it could have been tested but think of how disloyal hillary clinton was to debbie debbie think of it this was her crooked person this was her dishonest person this was her person that was rigging the system for she rigged the system carson never had a chance his people never had a chance i knew that i was saying i'm the one that came up with the term rigged system and i said it a year and a half ago pertaining to my system and frankly had i not one all of these states by massive landslides i wouldn't be standing it you have some stiff and they'd be 10 people in the office you know what you have a different kind of guy that'd be about 12 people sitting in the first row are two congressmen wouldn't be here this cell we don't want to be be a whole different thing and you'd be down 12 points instead of up seven in the state of pennsylvania right right where it is but here's the thing i'm a loyal person when cory had a problem i was little i stuck with everyone said corey should be fired why i looked at the tape what happened i'm a loyal person ok i'm a loyal person you got to be loyal to people if they do nothing wrong now in her case you did a lot wrong but she did it wrong and you know she knew hillary clinton knew what she was doing she knew the system was rick and as soon as she got caught because the emails came out and as soon as she got caught hillary clinton said you're fired get her out of here get her out of here that's what we have its weakness it's just loyalty and this woman she wanted so hard to remember she went the other day in front of the florida delegation ordered a rougher up like she deserves it look she's a dishonest person she deserves but she rigged the system against bernie in favor of hillary and hillary dumped her like so fast so fast like i've never seen before and that's not what it's about loyalty can be a wonderful thing and in this case i thought it was incredible what happened now the things that were on those emails were incredible you talk about race religion women by the way if i ever said the things that are on those emails i would have been run out of town and probably had i gotten the nomination i would have been forced to come to scranton stand right here and say i'm getting out of the race they were the worst things and they're trying to slap him off there trying so hard just left them off and then i see her campaign manager i don't know young guy nice guy who knows and he's on television and he said that russia act them huh no no he said russia hacked him i'm trying to figure out how does he know that right so he goes i think it was one of the sunday talk shows right and he goes russia act and then he goes like i said huh how does he know he didn't really know what he said rush active and then he said uh trump com yeah i'm sitting watching say what i do what i do why did i do right top i wish i had that power yeah that would be power so he talks about russia's hacking the only thing he didn't says what was on the emails with sahara that's what the problem what was on the emails was an honor but i'll never forget it i'm sitting and watching everything falling asleep is a boring guy and he said russia with emails probably with china with somebody else might be a 400 pound person sitting in bed ok might be some of the greatest hackers of all time but he said russia and then he said trump and i it reminded me of john loves you ever see the liar jon lovitz right and saturday night live yeah yeah i went to harvard are harvard that's right i want to have this was like yeah russia hat yeah yeah i was trump dropped that's what i'm - whoa right now these are lying bad people from these are bad people these are bad bad people and they're incompetent people and we want to turn our country around we want to make great trade deals we want to have strong borders we want to have the wall we want the wall we're going to have the wall because we're going to stop drugs from boring into our country and people from pouring into our country all right i'll give you a quiz you want the quiz who's gonna pay for the wall who hundred percent a hundred percent you know i have these lands and you can hold it to him it just i mean honestly you hold me to it i have these clowns in the back these these pundits and their say mexico's never going to pay for the wall mexica you know how much money they make from us each year and i'm not including with the drugs i'm leaving that up i'm not which really is a terrible thing because when i won new hampshire the new hampshire people were unbelievable my first victory was in new hampshire where i by the way i here i have a seven-point lead get out you know i gotta take funny i have people politicians are running and some of them embraced me like these two characters ok but some of observable trump is to conservation and then i run i don't care that you know they don't endorse me not it doesn't make any difference to me i think i do better up i might do better without endorsements but i have states to greater up stand up rob will you please take about 42 seconds so and if i don't win this state you'll never be standing up again that i could write you better believe it so i have these politicians and their running and you know their senators and they said no no we don't want anything to do with complete high school controversial do you endorse while we support him much and please don't ask me that question then the pole comes out where i'm the leading that senator whoever it may be by a hell of a lot and all of a sudden we love mr. trump is great for america this is what we deal with hooks ok this is what we do with but in new hampshire um got a nice lead supposedly i mean a poll came out 7 points8 points more something like that a very good lead we're doing well we're doing well in states and remember this if a person on the stage with me and i speak well of all of them now because it would be nice if the party unified i don't think it matters from my standpoint of what i really don't like it matters but it would be nice i don't know why but she would be nice because we have to win but what i will say this we open up states meeting me meaning you you know we're together i'm a messenger i'm a message that's all i am believe me leave a message what i am that's what i am you know i was using this phrase for the last couple of months and i use it again america first i i use another but i use a hundred i use another the forgotten man now i have to add and woman but there is a all thing going around called the forgotten meant the forgotten man and women we have forgotten men and women who work hard who are making less money than they made 18 years ago who are working much harder than they worked 18 years ago and now they're older who can't afford their health insurance who hate looking at what's happening who can't stand the fact that a priest in france has his throat cut and he lies dying on the ground and they can't stand the fact that we're letting thousands and thousands and thousands of people pour into our country from areas of the world and we are going to have problems like you've never seen i've been very good at prognostication folks you see what i've been saying is all come true pretty much and hillary clinton wants five hundred and fifty percent more than obama of people coming in from that area of the world we don't have documentation we don't have paperwork we don't really know who they are i've spoken to the best law enforcement people in this country and they say there is really no way of saying who they are and where they come from ok they even stole our passport machine did you see that they stole our passport machine and they can make passports better than we can make passports ok so these people are pouring in and some of these people can cause problems and with me we're going to do safe zones we can help people were going to get the gulf states to pay because i don't want to pay our country we are 19 trillion dollars going to be 21 trillion very soon we are going to build safe zones and we're going to get the gulf states that we protect they wouldn't be there they have nothing but money and they're going to pay for the safe zones and we're going to build them in syria and we're going to take care of people but you know what we're not going to pay for because we can't pick but this isn't 40 years ago this is in 20 years ago this is now and we're going to make our country so strong and we're going to renegotiate our military deals you know i'm taking a lot of heat where they say old nato what he said all i said is we have many countries with 28 countries and nato right there are five that are paying their way the others the others because you don't get it straight they say back there donald trump doesn't like metal well i think that is great i said it's obsolete wolf blitzer on cnn ask me a question he said now he is fine he said what do you think i made and i have to understand i've been a businessman but i have good common sense in that business and six and i said neighbors absolutely because it's not covering terrorism and everybody smile left they thought it was funny three days later there are suing you know trump's right it's not covering terrorism and then a few weeks later a few few weeks later check out the wall street journal a few weeks later front page was teacher nato to open up terrorism division i said clean and to appoint a great guy is the head you know one of their guys who knows who knows it isn't a good old actor who knows his father if he's any good right we need your help father so so that was right and then i said the second thing so i said it's obsolete so their work on that and i like that i think that was fun but we have to adjust you know you can't go for so many years and no adjustment so now they have that but i also said because i've heard this that people aren't paying their fair share they're not paying their way and then the stupid people they say but we have a treaty they say what would happen if russia somebody attacks said i don't have the pet have the pit have they paid tell me that they pay well they haven't heard but we have a treaty is yet they have a treaty to have to pay we're going to end up in world war three protecting people and these people can pay we're going to protect and there's an article right here it says cover trump is right five countries out of 28 are paying their way so i want them to pay and here's the story they will pay it has by the right person they'll pay they'll pay and hillary clinton said we will protect our allies are all costs how to help can you get money if you're going to say that and we need money we have massive massive deficits we need money so it sounds cold it sounds terrible and then tonight you listen to obama's saying donald trump wants to give up nato he doesn't say it right i want to keep nato but i want them to pay i don't want to be taken advantage of we don't want to be the stupid people anymore ok we don't want to the super cool we're protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never even heard of it we end up in world war three and a country you know just come on give me a break now if they live up to their obligations as they should and by the way they do that they'll have more spirit in a certain way ok but have to pay same thing with japan and germany can you believe a lot of people before i ran did anybody know that we were protecting and paying for a large portion of the protection of japan which sells cars by the millions and germany and saudi arabia and south korea we sort of knew because we have 20 add thousand soldiers on the border so i said here it is gotta pee gotta pee so i talked about japan love japan many friends in japan great country they sell us cause i mean you talk about ripoffs you want to see a trade imbalance we sell them we they sell us cars we sell them beef and they don't even take the because they're farmers say we don't want american be fret even though it's the greatest be for the world don't don't so we sell them because they sell it because it's the greatest trade about you got to see it's like the floor is us the ceiling is japan we're not doing anything about it we don't do but on top of it we protect japan so general gets on sent obviously by obama and he said mr drop doesn't understand he knows nothing about defense i know more about offense and defense than they will ever understand believe me then they will ever know then they will have one so he said and this is a general now he says this number it's actually lower these are doesn't he understand that japan pays for fifty percent of its production and it's of the work we do ok they pay for fifty percent of the defense that we give them of the military protection that we give them so the newspaper calls up and this is mr. trump sir they pay for fifty percent of the military i say what they pay for a hundred percent of them what and the reporter goes up never thought of that they don't think of that and germany who has a mercedes have two people in there looking but look germany now i don't mind and i understand all the reasons why and we don't want them to arm and all of that stuff but you know the man that we know so well who's always threatening everybody in the region north korea if he all of a sudden gets a little more frisky than just words we end up in a massive war protecting somebody now here's our treaty with japan again i love japan i respect your pan i respect what they've been able to negotiate i think it's great but here's our treaty with japan if they get attacked we have to protect them essentially world war three right if we get attacked they don't have to do anything ok no good no good then there's a donald trump you here tonight they have all these guys lined up donald trump doesn't know about and i actually saw it today on television i saw a couple of people they call me one guy calls me he's a teacher in a big college could i come up to your office with my students i said off this is just what i want oh i'm so busy he comes up i treat him nice while ago it comes up to a nice take pictures were always stood and say yeah goes back then i see them on television and know nothing about because i cannot tie the fact that they are not paying into this why why am i right i mean you know give me a break so people agree with me but they don't tell you the story a lot of them said headlines donald trump doesn't like nato he wants to get out of nato they don't say what we're talking about so when they hear what they're talking about everybody says you know you're right so right now headline in a major newspaper two days ago five countries out of 28 are paying their way the rest of them are some of paying nothing because there's nobody to ask there's nobody has come so we're not going to be the stupid country anymore we're not going to be led by stupid people anymore and we're going to do such i mean think of this i had a moment where i said we're going to renegotiate nafta everyone's are all that's terrible i what's wrong with renegotiating where we're going to renegotiate then after deal it's draining our jobs all the stuff everyone said all donald trump wants to renegotiate he's against free trick and i just want good deal since all the one but all i want is good to us call him whatever you want right but it was a big story donald trump is going to renegotiate after it's not terrible i said let me ask you a question so i'm a good discussion so we get in the room with these folks i tell them pretty tough stories because i mean it you always have to be prepared to walk you have to be you cannot go into a negotiation unless you're prepared to work i'm prepared to walk from a bad deal is a bad deal anyway so i'm prepared you guys are i guarantee you're prepared to walk you've lost here for your businesses i mean i'm not going to go into it but i look at scranton pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs right look at these numbers look at these numbers look at these numbers scranton has lost forty three percent of its manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed afters not this is just forty three percent of manufacturing jobs so i don't think you'll be hard to convince i mean just white people but look why would anybody be upset if i want to negotiate deals make them better why would anybody care so i say i want to renegotiate after and everything the newspapers only the newspapers they say that's terrible i'm trying to figure why they have the national review and some of these conservative be upset they're upset about it i don't get it but i don't care because i'll do it ok i'm going to do it but but nobody understands now today or yesterday hillary clinton said first time ever in her life right i am going to renegotiate traitors not one mention of my name in the article not one mention not one mention gp gold standard right she had the gold standard she then saw me and television knocking the hell address because they don't turn you know you're talking about currency manipulation and evaluation they don't talk about many of the problem plus you know what i want to make a deal not a massive number of countries i want to make it a one on one individual country station simple make some simple nice and simple one two three you we don't like your bed 45 no good 6 these deals are so complicated so it's a five thousand page document that the only people in congress that red are our two congressmen and i promise you they didn't really be there okay don't work so this is a five-person page document that nobody read remember obamacare remember when obama came out with thousands of pages and they went to congress and nobody read it and then you had a wise guy from one of the good schools and he said it was a con job he said it was a konja and everybody was going to just go after that kind and you know what happens a couple of weeks go by the forget but i remember and i i will bring it up remember the guy he said that obamacare was a conjurer remember that it was all a big time and two weeks go by in the sort of fades than four weeks go by is over but it's not over with me so here's the thing i wanted to individual countries because what happens is when you do a lot of countries number one too complicated you have all you see the lines understand i look at it five thousand pictures you got to see the lines it's here here here it's like the craziest impossible and if the country one of the country's is bad you can't get out because it's such a complicated when i want to make trades with individual countries nice and simple lace is beautiful nice and moving out of the country miss behaves or takes advantage of us like they always do we just send them a note - sorry is your twenty five day notice ok we're breaking off track and you know what they'll do they'll go up and what we have to do to keep it going ok we'll make a better do what we do so look folks we are going to make this country so strong again we're going to build up our military is totally depleted we're going to build a wall we're going to take care of our veterans or veterans are great people we're going to take care of our veterans we're going to take care of our vets they've been forgotten so many people have been forgotten thank you thank you thank you thank you i just ask you this one thing i didn't need this and neither are you sitting in this room there's about 200 degrees okay the only good thing is you lose a lot of weight but look what i ask you is this you have to go november eight and you have to vote or we just all wasted on this is a movement but it's only really a movement if we went i i tell the story a lot about people to tell me what you've done has never been done in politics before all that stuff i said no it doesn't mean anything if i knew that i was going to win i wouldn't even waste my time doing it i wouldn't waste my time they said no no in terms of history what you've done has never been done is that it doesn't mean a thing unless we win ok doesn't mean a thing because we can't do what we're going to do and it's so simple we're gonna make things fair we're gonna make things fair so i only ask you one thing get every person you know we have to win the state of pennsylvania and i can't believe she has many advances i can't believe she has i don't believe she has many and the miners and the scale workers and the executives and the professors we've got them all we have to get out there we have to vote we can't sit back because this is a really vital state and you're going to see cause she's got a billion dollars to blow and she'll put on these crazy eights much of which is wrong i don't go into it but i don't even bother but they're wrong that false but she's gonna put on all these ants and you know what their false its thank you darling i love you to look at it i love them but look look thank you gonna put air you know what i was running in florida we wanted a landslide i went through two weeks events i was down there i said it was the most incredible thing i've ever seen you couldn't see i was dying to see an ivory soap ad but there was because truck with all negative events and i wanted a massive last night so somehow people understand the truth because they're really funny and full sins and vicious but here's the story come november eight you have to get out and vote because it is a movement and it's a movement like nobody seen they're talking about it all over the world where the cover of time magazine every two hours many covers of time magazine because of what's happened and you know my whole life i've been on time magazine i think a couple of times my whole life that's so bad and the last number of months i think it's six or seven times right that's pretty good so you tell me what's more important real estate or politics right but what really is more important is making america great again and that's what we're going to do i love you thank you very much get out and vote november and i love you thank you thank you yeah yeah thank you very much everybody it's great honor to be here thank you very sad when you look at a plant like this which was so prosperous said so many years of great success and so many employees working here and now you look at what's going on and it's it's quite a sad thing it's really my honor to be back in new hampshire you know you probably hear me a lot i talk about new hampshire because it was the site of my first victory and i don't have i've got so many friends up here it's been an amazing it's been an amazing state to me and i learned a lot i learned about the heroin pouring in and i said no way you look at these beautiful trees of these beautiful streams and lakes and everything else i said this is not heroin country it is heroin country and it's coming from the southern border much of it and we're going to take care of it and i told the people of new hampshire if i win we're gonna build the wall we're going to have an amazing border people are going to come into our country but they're going to come in legally and we're going to do a real job but i oh very very i do so much that the people of new hampshire i mean getting that first one you know we have to watching politics all of my life all of my life i watch politics and new hampshire has that special ring to it and also for the people of new hampshire you know theres big movement to move you to the back of the pack trump wins that's not happening i can guarantee i can guarantee you that i can guarantee you that so we're going to take some questions in a little while this was sort of a special group of people that we invited just a small one we're going to be in and out but we're going to take some questions i'll say a few words i want to introduce the elements worked here for many years mike and mike actually had the distinct lack of honor of training people from mexico to take his job and that's exactly what he did he came up mr. trump could have a picture he said i said who you said mike i worked how many years mike 29 years and he took a gloves group of people he trained them there right now down in mexico the company moved to mexico he trained the people that took his jobs and it's a very sad thing just say a few words like i just hi excuse me i just like to say that on i back donald trump a hundred percent america can be great again if we just give it that one could try and i mean for all it's worth you know this place used to be a place i called home where i my bread and butter was i continue to work and prosper but however it's just heartbreaking and heartbreaking to see the jobs go to mexico and outside of the country i like to see donald trump make america great again thank you i didn't even know mike endorse me but i'll take that we have a lot of endorsements i'll tell you that the voters are our biggest endorsement we have a lot of endorsers so thank you mike and we'll get things moving and we'll get them changed so this is the sylvania where it closed its plant they close the plant a hundred and thirty-nine workers went to mexico they also went to china that was in 2014 and here's what you have right now you have rockwell some of the people that moved out of just this area in new hampshire you have rockwell automation inc it closed its plant a hundred and seventy workers moved in this case all to mexico that was in 2009 ethan allen interiors closed its plant laid off 260 people the workers all moved to mexico and it wasn't so much the workers the workers stayed here for the most part people from mexico to fill jobs freudenberg not closed its plant and laid off a hundred and twenty workers they move their jobs to mexico in 2008 risen amm's closed its plant laid off 40 workers and move their jobs to mexico regional job losses have been fantastically poor fantastically bad and disgraceful new hampshire's lost thirty one percent of the manufacturing jobs since nafta just think of that thirty-six percent since china entered the world trade organization that's a lot of jobs that's a big chunk almost fifty percent of your manufacturing pennsylvania's lost 30 pretty six percent of their manufacturing jobs since nafta and thirty-four percent since china and to the wto ohio and remember bill clinton signed after just for those you that have any questions bill clinton signature right on the bottom ohio lost thirty four percent of their manufacturing job since and after thirty two percent since china entered the w do another clinton disaster main lost thirty nine percent of their manufacturing job since nafta thirty-nine percent and thirty-four percent since china entered the w do so you know it's just it's not very hard to explain it's not very hard to understand what is difficult is to figure out why people did this why you know we have expansion plans in this country we have also it's a plans but there's no expansion we have job losses and other countries have a massive expansion we have 500 billion dollar trade deficit with china massive trade deficits with japan take a look at the imbalance in trade between japan and the united states they send us millions of cars we send them beef and you want to take a look at a chart sometime and just take a look at the difference between what we send them and what they send us mexico and i respect mexican respect their leaders what they've done to us is incredible their leaders are so much smarter so much sharper and it's incredible in fact that could be a mexican playing up there they're getting ready to attack so that's the way it is folks i just want to say that this is a factory and the legacy really of hillary clinton and bill clinton because this legacy is largely do and you could actually say entirely due to nafta the pet plant closed its doors and shipped its jobs to mexico china they did commercial lighting they were very big companies to do business with them the real clinton global initiative is their economic plan to ship america's jobs overseas that's what's happening whether we like it whether we don't like it it's what's happening and everybody knows it so you're looking here really in a plant and the wreckage of nafta and the wreckage of china's entrance into the world trade organization america's lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 this is america we're talking about since 1997 driven by these two hillary clinton understood and back and bill clinton certainly as the president's initiatives they are a disaster and now they want to go into tpp trans-pacific partnership that will make nafta in my opinion look like a baby trans-pacific partnership it's over 5,000 pages long every country that's in that partnership has studied every word every , every sentence every paragraph our guys probably haven't even read it this is the way we do business all you have to do is look at obamacare look at what past where congress the senators practically nobody even read it and now do we have a mess with obamacare so the same thing is going on with tpp just like hillary clinton push through the trade deal with south korea that killed another 100,000 jobs and she pushed it through what past where congress the senate is practically nobody even read it and now do we have a mess with obamacare so the same thing is going on with tpp just like hillary clinton push through the trade deal with south korea that killed another 100,000 jobs and she pushed it through after pledging she wouldn't and she did pledge she was not going to do that but it happened so south korea another big beneficiary and we protect them we have 28 thousand soldiers right now on the line between north and sell and what happens what happens if there's a war we get involved in the meantime they're killing the sun train nothing against south korea i do a lot of business with south korea have buildings over there but honestly we have to get smart folks we can continue to do this they are economic behemoth we protect them they don't reimburse us for what it's costing and we're going to sue no 21 trillion dollars as a country and our infrastructure is a mess and many of our plants and factories are just like this that standing to the side of me new hampshire's lost thirty-seven percent of its manufacturing jobs since china joined the world trade organization and this was a deal that was very very much pushed by hillary clinton today our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is nearly 800 billion dollars so we have a trade deficit we trade we have a deficit of 800 billion dollars nothing new in fact it's amazing that for years we've had massive deficits now it's getting higher it's getting worse these countries are treating us like we're children because we have leaders that don't know what's going on the trade deficit was only 84 billion when bill clinton was first inaugurated so we've taken it from 84 billion which is a lot of money - now eight hundred billion dollars and going up going up fast unless i become president you will see a drop like you've never seen you will never see and don't forget when our factories closed the nearby businesses suffer and you see that in this area see that in every year look at new york state i won new york state in a massive landslide and i went around into it and i'm i'm from there but i had no idea when you go upstate when you go out two parts of long island suffolk suffolk county it's incredible when you take a look at the devastation when you take a look at the devastation that took place in new york and pennsylvania and connecticut connecticut is a great state i'll of connecticut devastation caused mostly by nafta caused mostly by companies moving out of connecticut and new york and pennsylvania and maryland by the way and rhode island i had these all at one time and delaware and we want every single county of every single state massive victory is because i understand the problem and it's about jobs it's about protection it's about stopping isis it's about a lot of things but it's also heavily about jobs and whether to change it and we're going to get it changed too fast that i can tell you and i can promise you that when you have large numbers of unemployed blue collar workers incomes don't go down across the country just across the entire country and it affects so many other businesses when a plant like this closes it just affects so much and so many other people so many other lives and so many other businesses when you force workers in america to compete with workers earning one dollar a day oversees our whole standard of living goes down we have workers for 18 years they haven't received an increase their real wages are lower now than they were 18 years ago they're working longer hours they're working harder they have jobs that they don't like as much and they make it less money and there are people in the audience don't raise your hand i don't want to embarrass you but there are people in the audience that are exactly in that position and you know a lot of people say well they make the goods cheaper well by the time they manufacture them and send them over the transportation is very expensive and all of these other things were better off paying a little bit more and having jobs so much better system the way it used to be we manufacture goods and we then sell those goods or other countries but we sell them to other countries and a lot of people say oh well the goods will be cheaper they'll come in they'll be cheaper yeah but we lost all our jobs so a better offer than not quite as cheap and the goods will also be of a higher quality because we do a higher quality good and well known for that but all of a sudden the jobs are gone and frankly the goods can come in cheaply the people don't have any money to buy him so that's a problem is that right so we became the richest economy in the world with the biggest middle class in the world by becoming the biggest producer the biggest producer in the world to wealth this created was shared all across our nation then came the ear of surging trade deficits everyone wanted to go out and let's go and our government made it possible so easy we start sending our factories to various countries in mexico is an unbelievably well mexico is unbelievable it's a mini version of what's going on in china you look at ford you look at so many different companies you look recent like a dame 10 companies just right off the bat you look at carrier air conditioning they closed right before my primary in indiana they might have been responsible for the victory other than bobby night is probably more responsible than anybody but but we had a big victory in indiana carriers leaving indiana going to mexico fired all that people so our middle class is wrong 10 percentage points since 1970 and chair of gdp controlled by workers has steadily declined and shifted to corporations and the corporations are your special interest people they're your people with a lot of clouds and the people that give camp in contributions to hillary clinton these are the people folks look you're living in a rigged system i used to say that about the primary because i'd win the state and i didn't get the bucks be like when a state by a lot and the delegates would go to somebody else's wait a minute i just want the state of louisiana how come the delegates are in mind well it goes this way and that way - no you don't understand and i think i brought out a lot of the flaws because i you know people maybe they live with us for years but i'd win states and all of a sudden i find out where my delegates and if i didn't win by massive numbers because the system's rick look at bernie sanders look what happened to him with the super-delegates you know the republican system is just as bad but it's more sophisticated because there are new super-delegates super-delegates too obvious but bernie sanders with the super-delegates i mean that whole deal was also rigged and i think we're going to get a lot of the bernie sanders voters because one thing we had in common it's not a lot but he knew that trade deals were terrible and i know the trade deals are terrible the differences i can fix the trade deals and make them phenomenal you know a couple of the people in the republican party said all g trump is going again straight i'm not against rate i just want to make better deals i think it's great i think having trade is great i want to make better deal and and i'm always so amazed i'm always so amazed when i see somebody talking about you know my viewpoints my viewpoints are very simple i want great deals for this country somebody said are you a free trader the answer is yes but they have free trade you have to have smart people we don't have smart people representing us or we have people that are controlled by the lobbyists and controlled by special interest but yes i'm a free training but they said well how do you define your stance and training one of the reporters asked me this question a few months ago and i said here's my stance on trading i want to make great deals for the united states call it fair trade : 3 trade call it just 10 different names we can give it i want to make great deals for the people of the united states i want to bring our jobs back i don't want companies leaving because we don't know what we're doing and if companies leave and fire as in the case of carrier and so many others this is going to be consequences they're not going to make their air conditioners in mexico send them into the united states we have 1400 people that are phenomenal people that helped build that firm send them into the united states and there's no consequence to know now there's a consequence the consequences they going to pay thirty-five percent tax when that air conditioner comes into the country and here's what's going to happen one of two things either they're not going to move which is mostly going to happen or if it's too late or they move because you want to look at the bottom line the bottom line is much different ok and we can have a strong border when i have a week border they can have to go through a strong strong border but here's the difference were either going to keep them here or we're gonna make a hell of a lot of money it's very simple and they gonna regret that they ever moved and we're going to keep everybody here they're not going to leave and i've watched over the years i've watched the government our government they don't have a clue they want to give interest-free loans they want to give all sorts of deals and one they don't have a clue a couple of cases i read about where they took the money and they left anyway so we got cheap money than they left because they didn't have good lawyers didn't say like you have to stay will give you your money stay so it's very simple they want to go to another country to pay tax to get their product back into they could go the rest of the world they can do whatever they want and don't kid yourself folks other countries do that with us we have a free deal with china they can put their stuff in no consequence no tax no nothing try doing business with china i have a couple of friends here that are very much involved with new hampshire they love new hampshire they can get their product into china and if they do get it and they have to pay a massive tax so you have to have a fair thing going on and we don't have anything fair there's nothing fair the real medium the real median earnings of male workers in america has decreased by almost a thousand dollars from 1973 here i mean think of it it's hard to believe and the real median earnings of female workers in america has decreased by 1154 dollars from 2007 to 2014 that's a short period of time median household incomes are now more than four thousand dollars less than they were in two thousand before we opened our markets to china hey i give china lot of credit i have great relationships i mean the largest bank in the world from china's attendant of minor one of my buildings i do tremendous business with china with condominiums i do business with bank of america which is one of the buildings i have in in a partnership with another great company in san francisco and 1290 avenue the america one of the biggest office buildings in new york came directly and indirectly right through china from nineteen forty-five to 2001 our economy grew at an average rate of three point five percent ok that's not great by the way that's not great if china goes below seven percent it's like you know world scandal they go to seven percent is like our where it would brag about 3.5 well now we have almost nothing after china joined the world trade organization our growth rate has been cut in half and right now our growth rate for the last quarter is down to practically zero it's practically zero those days are over the share of men here is something that's just said the share of men in their prime working years and not working and they're just not working so in their prime working is not working has nearly tripled since the late 1960s think of that i mean think of that as a statement for a country to trade policies of hillary clinton global finance ears and they're all controlling her they have a hundred percent they might as well stay and hillary clinton on their forehead they have total control over that's why she's going to approve dp just so you understand she totally approves you wanted it so badly she said this is the gold standards of trading packs this is the gold standard soul over television - over and then all of a sudden she heard me make a speech saying what's wrong with tp and she changed she said i no longer supported so she went from the gold standard - i don't support it because she didn't like what i was saying so she went against it now what happens is if she ever got in which would be a sad sad day for our country and our workers especially they'll take a sentence that doesn't mean anything make a little change change a little , here there and she'll say now i can finally support it it's wonderful and that will be worse than nafta signed by her husband that would be worse than after that will make nafta look like a toy okay look like a toy so just remember i said it hopefully we don't have to experience that but she will sign it assures you here and sign it 100% the greatest age yet is the tpp another hillary clinton trade deal and that's it it's going to happen you know one of the things with tp the single biggest weapon used against us and to destroy the company's is the evaluation of currencies and the greatest ever at that is china very smart they're like grand chess masters they are there and we like checker players but bad one they have done such a job on us with the evaluation and nafta doesn't cover the subject and i've said if you're going to approve this ep and if you're going to approve any treasure you have to cover currency manipulation because there's such tremendous currency manipulation now tpp it's not mentioned i won't tell you some of the people that went crazy when they wanted to bring it in and put it in because i went out and i actually did a radio ad for a group of people that love this country and they did it and add on currency manipulation how it's not covered by tp and if you would have seen the people that were opposed to that what do we have to lose by having it it's like why are people upset that with free trade that i i like that i want to make better deals i said i want to make better deals with mexico i want to make better deals with china does it all trump is messing with free trade know i'm messing with bad deals that we can make good i can make good deals why would somebody fight i mean the us chamber fights they said all truck wants to stop free trade i don't want to sell free trial of free trade but i want to make great deals i want to take a deal that's faulty but we're losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year if i can make it good is that a positive thing okay that's something bernie can't do he's right that they're bad but he won't be able to fix them i'll be able to fix them and we can fix them there are consequences again we don't trade and you know how long that'll last for about 24 hours before they come to the table but you have to be able to walk every time if you're going to make a good deal you have to be able to walk john carried never walked from the randalls one of the most embarrassing deals i've ever seen in my life too horrible deal with this is a deal it's an embarrassment he never walked he lost every single point they get a hundred and fifty billion dollars back they get everything we never got our our hostages we got them when the deal was going to be signed we should have those hostages year before we should have never agreed to a negotiation we should have said no way we should have left the room and we should have said guess what we're doubling up your sanctions they would have been back on the telephone please come back please please please we beg you come back and you know what's going to happen it would assign the hostages would have been out years ago so it's just it's said and i just you know i i leave you with this because and then we're gonna take some questions but we've had some pretty good people representing us over the years i'll tell you we've had some very very great people and let me tell you what they said about trade because these are our finest ok and we also have a one other thing i just want to and i think i have to say this we have to immediately withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership immediately we cannot continue to go on it's such a one-sided bad deal done by the special interest we have to a drill we have to withdraw ok we have and we should seek a guarantee from hillary clinton that you won't sign it and we'll make great trade deals with people i want to make great deals i like one-on-one deals i don't like massive numbers of countries where nobody's reading accept them but we want one-on-one with countries that treat us properly and we're going to treat them properly i . the toughest and smartest trade negotiators who will fight for the american worker that's what we have to do we have no choice we have to do it direct commerce secretary i will do that to identify every violation of trade agreements then direct all agencies to use every available tool to end the abuses these are abuses these are like oh gee this is not quite working at these are abuse they are abusing us they're taking advantage of us because they think we are being led by very very stupid people believe me these are abuses tell on after partners we want to renegotiate after one or in addition hey we want a better deal ok this includes dealing with the vat on our goods mexico instituted after we eliminated the tariff and improving worker protections in both countries in both countries if we don't get a better deal we will withdraw under article 2205 very simple we said we withdraw i don't think we'll ever was draw because if they ever thought we were going to withdraw they'll give us everything we want as an example we have a situation where some of the richest and biggest and most powerful countries in the world we protect they only pay us a fraction of what it costs to protect him i said they gotta pay up and we have to be prepared to with you i don't want to withdraw but you have to always be prepared you can't say oh gee we're never going to withdraw because they're going to say but we're never going to negotiate so hillary clinton said we will stay with our allies we will never leave our relatives i think it sounds good sounds wonderful except for one thing can make a deal because the allies are now going to say well listen to her we're never going to leave now i'll tell you there may be a point where we withdraw for two hours before we get a phone call okay but you can't say we're never ever ever going to leave we protect japan we protect germany we protect south korea we protect saudi arabia saudi arabia so much money it's it's there's never been anything like it they wouldn't be there for a month if we didn't protect him they will do whatever we want and we want to be fair to them we want to be fair to everybody but they have to pay we have these massive deficits were like a debtor nation i told you 20 1 trillion dollars very soon and we're protecting the world this is in 30 and 40 and 50 years ago folks were living in a different time instruct the treasury secretary to label china currency manipulator instruct us trade representatives to bring cases against china's unfair subsidy behavior and they subsidize all these people that go out they come into our country and they kill our company's look at what's happening with the steel they're dumping product all over the place they're dumping they are dumping so much product are steel companies are getting killed i'm going to protect our steel workers i know more about steel workers and anybody that's ever run for office these are great great people they are being killed just like the workers mike and the workers here are being just destroyed they train their workers and then they lose their job think of it i mean how how sad is that if china does not immediately stop its improper practices including theft of trade secrets and intellectual property that cost us millions and millions and millions of jobs and actually threatens the security of our country i will use every lawful power to stop the cheating because that's what it is cheating including tariffs under section 201 and 301 of the trade act of 1974 in section 232 of the trade expansion act of nineteen sixty two trade expansion huh trade expansion for who so i just wanted to go through a few of those points and you know there are so many things that we could talk forever about trey there's nothing that's closer to my heart than trade there's nothing that's closer to my heart actually than the workers that are being so badly hurt so badly taken care of by what we're doing and it's just not going to happen anymore when you look back and you look at our great leaders abraham lincoln said we have to protect yourself from goods pouring into our country we want to be a manufacturer we want goods pouring out of our country and we want to be paid for it george washington talked about it so many talked about it the great ones talk about it the ones we have today they want to protect the rest of the world i think it's almost as though they want to protect the world and they don't care about our workers and hillary clinton honestly is one of the great abusers she doesn't understand the workers she said recently few months ago that she wants to put the miners out of business essentially she said i want to put the miners i'm going to put the miners out of business by the way she didn't do too well in west virginia i don't imagine she's going to do - well and if you look at pennsylvania and if you look at some of the other places wyoming some of the other places i can't a man who would vote for she said i want to put the miners and the mines out of business who would vote for her we want to put our people back to work we're going to put them back to work just remember we're putting our people back to work thank you very much ok how about a few questions from anybody guess they're go ahead yes thank you thank you for your comments today on what's a very important issue to me as a manufacturing guy that's good and you know cheap products are actually really very expensive and i believe people don't realize that you're right i believe it is a really simple answer the best answers with the really simple answers and your cultural leader today you aspire to be a political leader but right now you're a cultural leader and you can use that position to create a cultural change it's really simple take about an hour and it cost zero dollars and with that we can read structure manufacturing in this country and bring back jobs and eliminate china as a source it's really very very like i don't want to eliminate journey i want them to just treat us fairly forgot to eliminate john i want china's cell tremendous numbers of products and items to our country i don't want to eliminate him so so and they can't cheat us any longer that's cheating so where were they when they do their monetary manipulation they manipulate the p value when they do that that's just killing us every time they do it we lose jobs in this country good so so i see that it's up to us the people with the people we get to decide what to buy and if we have a cultural preference for purchasing the american-made manufactured product then what that will do is it will create the man for american products so we're right and let me just tell you it's a good point because in japan and in china they really want to buy products made in japan and in china was the united states we buy anything and our people should have more pride in buying made in the usa remember the old days we had made in america are made in the usa and we should put that on i think i'm going to do that we should put that up right it made in the usa go so thank you very much so you know there are countries that don't want to buy you know when we do business as an example with japan many friends in japan they know it's true they know they send the cars we send the beef lot of times they send it back we send things to them they send it back and get it can't pass certain tests okay and it's better product than what they have they send it back china since things back and i said before they tax us but they send it back they'd rather send it back to texas but if we ever get it in what they did look what they did with boeing build a plant we get all of your your information we get everything you've ever worked for for so many years for building airplanes we gonna take this we're going to take that and south carolina which is an amazing state that i love so much and you look at the entire washington state area and where they make so many boeing's and be careful because they're building massive boeing plants in china massive and so and in addition to that china is building their own plants which is probably even a bigger problem but they force bowing to build these massive plants and then all of a sudden they'll do an evaluation and another devaluation and boeing will make a hundred percent of the airplanes not from south carolina where they just moved and built some incredible facilities not from washington state in the seattle area they're going to build from china and they going to do that by devaluing their currency and i tell the people of south carolina actually which was great to me which was a big win for me i said be careful because that's what's happening as sure as you're sitting there and in five years you say you know that trump was right okay yes you're good avoid some of the floyd over 22 people we had some of the finest tool and die makers in the country we have the latest technology we spent a million dollars and equipment is myself my father it was my great uncle we lost all of that to china and you know what you're making police badges sacred they're all being made in china all you have to do is type in police badges california china and it's all there i lost all that business a million dollars i call my congresspeople up hey there's something on fair here they're making this item two thirds less than me i said that's material costs i went to them i've got nothing from it always all after we train the work is for what we had full blue cross we had paid vacations we had 40 one case i used to be able to take a two-week vacation that's gone what are you going to do for us ok so i think i think first of all your story is common to thousands and thousands of companies throughout this country and in the end what we're going to do very easily is we're going to make it so when somebody country when they currency manipulate when they devalue their currency which as you know makes it impossible to compete it's costing us a fortune folks you know it sounds good but it costs because we lose all those jobs and you're better off paying ten percent more fifteen percent more for the badges or whatever they may be and all of these people are still working it's cheaper for our country we make it's very profitable for our country now we don't play the game the way they play the game they play the game to win we play the game in this country to survive we're going to start playing the game to win so just hang in there i know it's not easy but hang in there man hang in so said and what you just said thousand use and thousands of companies in our country thank you go ahead how about go ahead alright so when you talk about a countering this kind of globalism effort with bringing more profits back to the united states although that seems very good for small business in the middle class how do you plan on dealing with a corporate backlash for larger companies who can make a much larger profit when they are x when they're actually don't have a lot of backlashes and you know you're going to have a backlash where maybe people are going to move from new hampshire but they're not going to move out to mexico and they're not going to move out that they can move to another state like with carrier carry my move to another state plenty to choose from and this way you can really do your own thing corporations i'm not worried about don't forget my tax plan is cutting business taxes way down and cutting taxes for middle income and everybody way down and we're going to have a over the next 2-3 weeks we're going to have a very very highly sophisticated tax plan done with some of the best people the best economist the best minds in the world for it we're going to really have some plan coming up and we put the rudiments in and the real rudiment is we're going to simplify our tax code number one and we're going to cut the hell out of taxes with the highest taxed or just about the highest tax nation in the world and our businesses can compete with other businesses for that reason also so we're going to make it where the corporation's want to come back and part of the reason and part of the problem that corporations have in all fairness is they have to pay so much text we have i think five trillion but they say to an after you and i think it's a much higher number than that outside of this country where corporations have this money they can't get in because the taxes are so high and because the bureaucracy is just as bad as the taxes so company's corporate inversions companies are actually leaving the united states and going to other countries to pick up their money because they can't get their money in and that money could be used to rebuild the united states you're talking about trillions of dollars so all of these things are covered by me and i have to say the democrats and the republicans for years all agree on this what's what's not to agree with we're going to bring our money into the united states trillions of dollars would bring it into the united states right i don't really need those notes because i don't need notes aren't i lucky that i don't need are like drama way groaning nice nice to have that ability is that as a good ability to have any way but we will do things that are going to be so miraculous and it'll be fast it won't take a long period of time and you know when china who have a great relationship with china made a lot of money with china can make money with china it's hard to believe as a citizen looking at what they've done to us but we can make a lot of money with china i love having open marks with china and when they know that they're going to be consequences for they're cheating they're not going to do what they are doing i'll give an example they're building right now one of the largest military fortresses in the world in the south china sea now they're taking our money they're taking our jobs that taking our pride our pride and they're violating everything there is to violate by building this massive fortress in the south china sea and unlike us they don't get environmental impact permits by the way they say build it they still work the following our we say build something they start work 12 years from now or does it ever happen ok can you imagine that they're building island it took they have the biggest excavators in the world sitting out in the sea ripping the hell out of the ocean out of the sea ripping the hell out of it and they don't say like oh gee we have to file for an environmental impact permit they just do what they do that's because they don't respect us that's why they do it they have no respect for our leader they have no respect for a country a very very important man in the world of politics and well beyond politics said to me donald i totally disagreed with your tour you know because i've had this stuff stands for a while a long time for a long time if you go back it's actually years many years but he said i really disagreed your tough talk on china and saudi arabia and all these countries paying us paying us paying us and i totally just agreed except for one thing i've been called by all of these countries how do we set up with trump how do we make trump like us how do we do it how do we do it now i'm not saying that in a braggadocious why i'm just saying that's the way life is there are no repercussions right now at all for what all of these countries are doing to our countries to our jobs to our workers none the story that you just told i mean there are none and your congressmen are all these comp people and the senate people in congress congress when i know everyone and some are really fine people and some aren't and some senators are really fine people and some aren't but many of them are totally owned by and taken care of by lobbyists and special interests because a friend of mine said how could the united states allow ideal like so-and-so to happen and i said because the special interests take care of you did my friend is very smart and very successful but very naive couldn't believe that anybody so he said this stupid i said no they're not stupid they're totally controlled by their lobbyists and they're totally controlled by the special interest and when its campaign season millions and millions of dollars are given to some of these people and it's so simple do i know the system well okay how about one more question that's it go ahead you want to talk hello that's right get that mike get that mic over there my i'm not can i hold you let him hold it let him home he was a man there's a man that knows what he wants that's my kind of guy go ahead of you this might shock you but down we have something in common good respect for human life thank you okay now i have two comments on my deep reach back for human life ok number one you can comment on my objections number one and number two ok number 1 i'm opposed to the murder of unborn baby being legal number 2 i'm opposed to are we wasting our military in the middle east on behalf of zionist israel thank you all right well that leverages tell you that israel is a very very important ally of the united states and we are going to protect them one hundred percent one hundred percent they've been our most reliable it's our true friend over there and we're going to protect israel one hundred percent as to number one we all were with you ok one more we had asked one more because i was a tough question on israel ack i was nasty whoa we offer israel right yeah okay go ahead let's go thank you very much i ok we're for america - i agree i would say that most of us here read out of the same economic playbook as you write most of us are probably self-employed so we agree wholeheartedly what i would like in front of these cameras once and for all please put to bed that you will adhere to and follow the united states constitution is presented as our compass for governance okay that i'm not by the way hundred percent i love the question or the statement in this case but one hundred percent you know during the primaries where i beat everybody very easily that was sometimes said will he follow the constitution folks one of the great great instruments ever written ever conceived we're with the constitution one hundred percent ok so and you think hillary clinton whatever doing his conference like this totally underrated and by the way speaking of unvetted we're going to take care of our vets just remember that al my al al is i met alan new hampshire i always say he's one of the most loyal people i've ever known he loves the vets he fights for the vets he went to everybody's speeches during the new hampshire primary and even before and all of a sudden i noticed he was at mine more and more and i said who is this guy and he's an unbelievable veteran respected by the veterans more than anybody i know we have the guys with the fancy suits and the ties that get the big consulting money this is the guy that's respected more than anybody i know and stand up and after after a couple of months of listening to everybody else on both sides democrat and republican he came to us he said there's nobody that's gonna take care of the vets like you and i want to come on board and he is the most amazing guy and i'll tell you what he's one of the great things that's happened to me because we formulated plans and done things that he's taken back to large groups of veterans and we have plans that are better than any plans ever submitted and it's going to work well for the vets work well for the country and we're going to be proud that we take care of our veterans and they're going to be proud of our country again oh thank you ok that all the women's auxiliary i think the women like me i don't know i see by the way thank you yes go ahead god good but i want to tell you i'm sorry i would like to tell you i want to thank you first of all for everything you've done for the veterans we all in the vfw know what you've done even if you don't come out and say it ok very much we appreciate it but just to mix quickly homeland security and jobs why are we putting our retiree our military retirees on that border or in tsa get rid of all these hit tv jobbies they wear at tla are you know myself we need the veterans back in there to take it they fought for this country and defended it they'll still do it okay thank you you know and we are looking at that and we are looking at that we look at a lot of things i have to tell you as long as you bring it up though in terms of the border some great people and now you know this we were endorsed i was endorsed by 16,500 border patrol agents these are the people to take care of the border and first time they've ever endorsed in the history of the union or the group it's the first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate and i don't even know if they're supposed to be doing it they said we don't even care at this point it's 16,500 incredible people out these are incredible people that want to do their job it's easier for them not to do the job but they want to do their job and so i was really honored by that and i was also as you know into us by sheriff joe from arizona who who's had some great victories lately so sheriff joe is great so we're going to do a job i just in finishing just before i came up i was told rasmussen one of the most highly respected poll just came out with four points ahead so that's ok 44 . sad so we're going to have something i think that's going to be very exciting thank you very much thank you everybody thank you ok yeah yeah oh yeah oh off i i ok i yeah oh yeah ok thank you everybody thank you thank you thank you for joining me today this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what's going on and especially how poor she do as president in these very very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism even her former secret service agent who's seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and i will deliver that speech very very soon but today there is only one thing to discuss the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since sep tember eleventh and the worst mass shooting in our country's history so many people since i mean just hard to believe but just so many people dead so many people gravely injured so much carnage such a disgrace sahara is beyond description the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated and they will be forever likewise our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated we express our deepest sympathies to the victims the wounded and their families we mourn as one people for our nation's loss and pledge our support to any and all who need it i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack thank you our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community they have been through something that nobody could ever experience this is a very dark moment in america's history a radical islamic terrorists targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation it's a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation it's an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity it's an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country we need to respond to this attack in america as one united people with force purpose and determination but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly we're not acting clearly we're not talking clearly we've got problems if we don't get tough and if we don't get smart and fast we're not going to have our country anymore there will be nothing absolutely nothing left the killer whose name i will not use or ever say i was born in afghan of afghan parents who immigrated to the united states his father published support for the afghan taliban regime which murders those who don't share its radical views and they murdered plenty the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here that is a fact and it's a fact we need to talk about we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly we have an incompetent administration and if i'm elected president that will not change i will tell you that will not change over the next four years we have an administration that will not change but if i get in there it's going to change and it's going to change quickly we're going from totally incompetent to just the opposite believe me thank you with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore we have to address these issues head-on i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great school and hank but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so and although the pauses temporary we must find out what is going on we have to do it it will be lifted this band when and as a nation we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country they are pouring in and we don't know what we're doing the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons now any class it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states and its as he or she deems appropriate hopefully it's he in this case thank you i will use this power to protect the american people when i'm elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats after a full thank you and by the way we have no choice after full and partial and long really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions remember this radical islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-american i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people christian people jewish people are targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence this is not just a national security issue it's a quality of life issue if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans women and children gay and straight jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores and is coming with these people folks it's coming we're importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people were letting into america all of the september eleven hijackers were issued visas large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis the boston bombers came here through political asylum the mail shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife the other terrorists from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly fivefold five fault in just one year according to pew research ninety-nine percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law we admit many more and that's just the way it is we admit many more from other countries in the region and i'll tell you what they share these oppressive views and values we want to remain a free and open society then and if we do then we have to control our borders we have to control and we have to control them now not later right now ok yet hillary clinton from months and despite so many attacks repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday and guess what she will probably say them she sort of has said them but let's see what happens she really has no choice but she doesn't want however she's really been force and she has been forced to say these words she supports and the reason is she supports so much of what is wrong and what is wrong with this country and what's going wrong with our country and our borders she has no clue in my opinion what radical islam is and she won't speak honestly about it if she does in fact no she's in total denial and her continuing reluctance to ever named the enemy broadcast weakness across the entire world true weakness i don't know if you know this but just a few weeks before san bernardino the slaughter that's all it was a slaughter hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam here is what she said exact quote muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism that is hillary clinton so she says the solution is to ban guns they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans abolishing the second amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns no good not going to happen folks not gonna happen not gonna happen yeah she wants to take away americans guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us let them come into the country we don't have guns let them come in let them have all the fun they want i will be meeting with the nra which has given me the earliest endorsement in a presidential race to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror i will be always defending the second amendment ok hillary clinton's catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic into immigration into this country threatening not only our society but our entire way of life when it comes to radical islamic terrorism ignorance is not bliss its deadly totally deadly the obama administration with the support of hillary clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have just no intelligence gathering information we need this information so badly and he stopped it we don't have the support we don't have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job they are not being allowed to do their job and they can do it well better than anybody we need a new leader we need a new leader fast they have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else i refuse to be politically correct i want to do the right thing i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again the days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if i'm elected as president i will give our intelligence community law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks that they don't have those schools now we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none second to none that includes medical operation between state local and federal officials and with our allies very importantly i will have an attorney general a director of national intelligence and his secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right not like it is right now it's not right we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states in september 11 nearly a year ago the senate subcommittee as president obama's department of justice stay and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states these departments refused to comply nobody even knows why they refused to comply president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since sep tember 11 so important the public has a right to know how these people got here how they came onto this great land why are they here we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs very simple we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america not complicated every and and just think of this take a look every single event even a single individual can be devastating and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases just a single event and just one person can you imagine what they'll do in large groups which were allowing now to come here truly our president doesn't know what he's doing he's failed us and he's failed us badly and under his leadership this situation will not get any better it will only get worse and i've been saying that for a long time each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east our government has been admitting ever growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our own security in fact clinton state department was in charge of admissions and the admission process for people applying to enter from overseas having learned nothing from these attacks she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a five hundred percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country tell me tell me how stupid is that this could be a better bigger more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was all together under the clinton plan you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them what to report to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children not only their children by the way they're trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don't know what's happening the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system system - really - screen we're not screening people so why don't we have an effective screening system we don't were being left at all over the world the bird is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term wouldn't this be money better spent rebuilding america for a current population including the many poor people already living here we have cities we have inner cities we have poverty all over and this is how we're spending billions of dollars we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states we don't know who they are they have no documentation and we don't know what they're planning and we won't unless we have proper supervision and proper leadership in which case they're out of here what i want what i want is common sense i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values that's a choice i put before the american people a mainstream in a great immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interest that's all it is we've got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we've got to do it now because later is too late going to be too late for our country the media talks about homegrown terrorism but islamic radicalism and it's a very very important term a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it our imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don't like it yes there are many radicalize people already inside a country as a result of poor policies of the past but the whole point is that we will be much much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don't keep on bringing people who add to the problem and that's what they're doing we're letting all of these people hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they're doing is adding to this incredible problem we have for instance the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had and its founder and as its founder and immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father was supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth why would we admit people who support violent hatred hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continued - support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women gays and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values she can't have it both ways she can't claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to impress these same communities how does this kind of immigration make our lives better how does this kind of immigration make our country better why does hillary clinton want to bring people in invest numbers who reject our values why explain ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the l be and lgbt community donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words i will tell you who the better friend is and someday i believe that will be proven out piggley and by the way the lbgt community is just what's happened to them is just so said and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is to disgrace to that community i will tell you right now clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country they enslave women and they murder gays i don't want them in our country immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities all of our communities every single one of them america is already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth anybody in the world four times more at least because we don't even know who's coming in and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny not surprisingly wages for our workers haven't budged in almost 20 years you wonder why we get the crowds you wonder why we get this tremendous support you wonder why i've got more votes than any republican in any primary and the history of the republican party take a look at that take a look at your security but take a look at the wages for 18 years they've been stagnant they've even gone down so whether it's a matter of national security or financial security we can't afford to keep on going like this cannot afford it we owe 19 trillion dollars in debt and no longer have any options are communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief this is not an act of offense against anyone it's really an act of defense i want us all all of us to work together we have to form a partnership with our muslim communities we have muslim communities in this country that are great and we have to form that partnership now the muslim community so importantly they have to work with us they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad and they know it and they have to do it and they have to do it forthwith i want to fix our schools i want to fix our bridges and our jobs market we're going to have it rocket again we're going to make great trade deals but i want every american to succeed including muslims but the muslims have to work with us they have to work with they know what's going on they know that he was bad they knew the people in san bernardino were bad but you know what they didn't turn them in and we had death and destruction hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens i want to protect our citizens all of our citizens the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault in san bernardino as an example people who know what was going on they know exactly but they use the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it they said all we thought so but we didn't want to use racial profiling which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don't get in trouble we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what if any is their immigration status we have to know and we have to know fast we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with we need to know and we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us is brought to justice so when people know what's going on and they don't tell us and we have an attack and people die these people have to have consequences big consequences america must do more much more to protect its citizens especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation as you just saw in orlando it also means we must change our foreign policy the decision to overthrow the regime in libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before these actions along with our disasters iran deal have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation-building no more nation-building it's never going to work and by the way we've spent almost five trillion dollars over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been a complete and total disaster were further away now that we were 15 years ago for instance the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya that mission helped unleash isis on a new cotton i've said nato needs to change his focus and stop terrorism we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism since i've raised that criticism and it's okay i've got no credit for it but these are minor details nato has since announced a new initiative front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war we've tried it president obama's way doesn't work he gave the world his apology tour we got isis and many other problems in return that's what we got remember the famous apology to her with sorry for everything i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack when i'm president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders wherever they come from wherever they were born i don't care all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected thank you we're gonna be tough and we're gonna be smart and when to do it right america will be a tolerant and open society america will also be a safe society we will protect our borders at home we will defeat isis overseas we have no choice we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety we will make america rich again we will make america safe again we will make america great again thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you very much everybody yeah the half an hour because there are thousands of people outside trying to get in

every time i see him he doesn't even understand it i say i really can't do that i'm sorry i'm self-funding he goes no no that's okay it is even understand what i'm saying because he can't believe it because he's just funny and he's a good guy and a generous guy rich guy so that i come by a semi monthly seriously i'd like to give you ten million dollars a self-funding and you know for me me that's very hard to do so he's done it now four times and i just keep turning them down and i said to myself i wonder people appreciate it they made you know when i he's one of many people i have many many people like that and you know i say all my life i take right now take it is good we have employees we take care of their health care and education lot of good things but i take and ik and i keep taking and i become richer and richer but now i'm going to check for you i'm gonna take for the country because our country needs help our country needs help with being stripped of money being shipped to avoid shops we have people that don't know what they're doing and in some cases they don't care so we are going to change things around and want to change around these people of it i love you and i hope the people that are pouring in are not angry at be they'll go back and they'll say you know truck was really good but we only got to see the last nine minutes of his page but that's ok we should keep going pennsylvania where a place i love a place close to as you know that's where i learned how to play golf cobbs creek does anyone know where cops creek is a public course in philadelphia i used to play from the war and let me tell you you met people at cobbs creek that were actually very very sophisticated hustlers and if you could survive creek you could practically survive anywhere so we love philadelphia let me tell you folks we love we love i learned i learned a lot i learned a lot and pennsylvania alright so i left indiana and they have a company in indiana call carrier and indianapolis and i thought and i could use a hundred different companies and tell the story but i think it's a terrible story they've been there for many years they had 1,400 employees great people in fact a number of the employees were at the speech yesterday and i said what do you think and we talked to him and i talked to him afterwards great people they were there for 18 is one was there for almost 30 and you probably saw it on television where some semi mid-level guy was rough and he said with closing we're moving to mexico that carrier and i buy a lot of air conditioners from jerry i'm not buying them anymore folks understand so i've been watching politicians now for five years talking about keeping the companies in our country and they've done nothing they haven't done a damn thing and they can talk about free trade and i'm a free trader but you can only have free trade if you have smart leaders and smart negotiators and we don't we have leaders that are dumb as rocks they don't know what the hell is happening to our country and when you ride by these buildings in higher when you ride by the buildings in albany and in rochester and syracuse new york this is why i got the big vote because they understand that i get it and they don't get it they don't our politicians don't get us all his story here is what we do if we have to look at hillary was there anybody know is there anybody you know bernie sanders who in all fairness and i have to tell you in all fairness he said she has bad judgment alright she does in fact i'd like him to keep going because the longer he goes the more i'm gonna like it and what he's saying about her she said she suffers from bad judgment and she said i don't know i think she's qualified i guess but that doesn't mean she's good i mean i actually like he said she's not qualified to be president now because her judgment is so bad bernie sanders said she's not qualified so now i'm gonna say she's not qualified she has really really you look at her judgment i pinned against the war in iraq the war in iraq is david has been devastating we've spent two trillion dollars we probably have spent in the middle east four trillion dollars and we have wrote with potholes in the middle of the highways we have a report center up silly we have the words transportation system in train system in china they have trained two go two hundred and fifty miles an hour over here if the train goes more than 60 it's like collision territory and we see it all the time we got his start rebuilding this country we've got to rebuild our country now we shouldn't have been in iraq was a horrible decision the way obama got is out of iraq was a disaster he said a specific date and when i heard him say that i said he has to be done i said i it's camouflage he does it really mean that but he didn't mean it that was today the enemy sad fact they said they can't believe it they said why should we get killed believe me i dont wanna be killed they went back we left and we should we should have been out we should never ever done and we totally destabilize the middle east and i've been saying that for years but we went in mistake the way we got out was a mistake because we got out we didn't leave the troops we shoulda left some troops and now what's happened isis we also by the way put terrible people in charge of iraq and that's really a primary reason jeffrey why i just because they couldn't get they could get together because they were not inclusive and so i say that we have another problem and then you have all of the mistakes that hillary made a secretary of state a total disaster not even talking about benghazi i mean just big horrible mistakes so we have a mess so what we have to do i get them out good look at those beliefs do we love our police by the way cruz came to her as if he had two hundred and fifty people in a conference room i'd be surprised if he could get that many people i would actually be surprised and here we have 10,000 people i would be so surprised if he could even get that ok you're ready and honestly crews and kasich have no path to victory it's over it's over now crews chasing should get out because he has no path i mean not even trust he's 11 out of 38 well cruises only 11 10 or 11 22 or 23 i think they both should get out what are they doing what are they doing so we should we worry we have to finish the job we have to fear we should never ever happen you know saddam hussein was a bad guy right if you look at gaddafi he was a bad guy but they had one thing in common and one thing that they were really really good at number one they were not politically correct we all agree they were great at killing us we are not good at telling jurors week at somebody's a terrorist its 25 years before the trial starts they killed tires and we would have been better off if our presidents went to the beach and never even heard the words middle east that's how bet now it's a mess now we have people that are cutting off heads and drowning people in steel cages with a devices we are going to build a military that shopping and so strong and so powerful and by the way it's the cheapest thing we can do so big so strong so powerful that nobody is gonna mess with us again nobody just remember our military is being decimated is being decimated by cuts and every other thing and our soldiers are great people these are great people the military people but the politicians are all talk no action not treating red show a buildup of military we're gonna make a powerful and strong again and by the way we are going to take care of our our vets back so we have carried out when i first came in when i first june sixteenth who knew this was going to happen sooner this was gonna happen bill o'reilly last night on fox during his show i was really greatly complement that he said that what's happened with donald trump is the single biggest political event that has witnessed and seen during his lifetime i said wow i was pretty even jeffrey when i mean it was a big step you know i like bill but it was a big 70 is an important said and what he meant by that is this is all a movement no matter where we go we got our 35,000 people we had 25,000 and orlando 25,000 people over a minute routine if i say if they say to me like sure you have 10,000 people tonight is that that's a small crowd whats wrong whats wrong we have tremendous crowds we have by far the biggest crowds far bigger than burning by the way far bigger and bernie is second but now bernie is over i guess right and really i want to run against hillary i don't want to run against bernie i really wanna run against i wanna run against drunken hillary trend we're gonna be hurt real bad happens so carrier that are leaving indianapolis and this is so easy you have the best business leaders in the world you saw the other night when i wonder you are carl icahn businesspeople endorsement and was used to make a trade deal season the money that they wanted to add to them it's a chess game and they love the country but here's what happens so carrier announced 1,400 people get out your fired like to apprentice year fire just like that we're moving to mexico our government doesn't do anything about it and the politicians won't because that taken care of by special interest so they won't do anything about it so i can about blackout fessed up police work i read it all these police seized police we love our police they were running so what happens is our politicians do absolutely nothing absolutely nothing really and here's what i do now my wife is constantly say darling be more presidential i just know that i wanted to do it quite yet jeffrey because we have a job to do i've got two left overs after finishing ok we asked him we asked so good and we have to be tough for a little while and i'll be at some point i'm gonna be so presidential that you people will be so port and i'll come back as a presidential person and instead of 10,000 people have about a hundred and fifty people and they'll say but boy he really looks presidential but you know we have a very sad topic because we're talking about what's happened to our country but we have a very happy topic also because you don't believe it or not let's make america great again they america hours all of these statements are positive and the one i love is the one that sort of all those beautiful had some read some white is a bad hunters cap right make america great again that's a positive message that's a positive message so i wanted to carry myself because i love it i love working i'm not a vacation right like obama he plays golf and a wife liza 747 lies that he just about the carbon footprint he goes till why and the seven forty-seven vacation and then it comes back has a news conference on the carbon footprint of me give me a break fuck ok so here's the story i wanted carrier i know it's not president i don't want to give it to carl icahn i don't want to give it to these great business guides at the richest guys the best i don't want to give it to them i love doing this stuff i call up the president just carrier highly highly unpresidential the president of the united states calling up and air conditioning company but that air conditioning company abandoned 1,400 jobs in our country because our politicians are so stupid they allow it to happen and they've been talking about stopping at 25 years is called corporate inversions they don't even know what the words been so they've been talking about it for years so here's what we do i get up on the phone and i say good luck good luck with your new plant in mexico i hope you do fantastically but as you know you've terminated 1,400 people and as you know i don't like that and as you also know we now have a very strong border we have a border with the butter patrol men and women who by the way last week endorsed the 16,000 and these are great people that aren't allowed to do their job if they let him do the job you still need the wall to stop the drugs and other things these are great people they're not allowed to do the job sheriff joe arpaio also from arizona center so you know who the good one of the town i say here's the story enjoy your new plan enjoy the very very hot weather because his cell when you sell your you doin air conditioning in every single unit that crosses are now very strong border the other words you have to go through a certain way haven't come across like we have now every unit coming across the board is going to be tax at 35 percent for you now believe me i'm really good at this stuff up so good at this stuff i've built a great company so here's the story if you say it before they move that they're not going to otherwise you challenge before they move those home later you go up to a bad and what can we do we want to keep you know you're a good guy i guess wat you but if you move and umag product in mexico or wherever or wherever every unit coming across the border to be taxed at 35 percent now if they have that conversation with lion ted cruz always takes that could even those who is if they have a conversation with these guys a hundred percent a move that see if they have the conversation with hillary it's just what's going to be even worse you want to pick up the phone because what's going to happen is they'll up he is and this special interests will call the politicians say you can't do that million dollars when you ran and give you $1,000,000 you run you can't do this and other words they got now they tell me nothing nothing i won't take the call i couldn't care less so here's what's going to happen and i like talking to him before they move i went on to be for them because if it's before they move they gonna say the following they'll call me back within 24 hours and it was saying mister president sir we've decided not to move the united ok if they've already they're gonna try and undo that deal so fast i guarantee you and here's what happens maybe they can't come back maybe it's too late but our country's good folks we're gonna make a lot of money and we need the money we have massive deficits we r 19 trillion dollars and that's the way it is now on a larger bases floored ford motor company built to don't care about that here come the police looked at a move i love these police here i get take a matt is either right in front of the cameras right in front of the cameras where they want to be you know we had a couple of protesters we had some protesters in new york before i met his speech and the media went to him and by the way i see the media that is the most designers group of human being the show the crowd so i like it so i liked by protesters but in new york that protest shoes and they went up and they say why are you here do you not like donald trump highlight companies great guy and they have side manufactured by a beautiful printing press made in the basement like it's supposed to be they go up to another one why are you here and the guy goes i don't know it's only till it's a phony disgusting deal we had 12 does that very few of us have you heard about protesters they giving up with us because we like it we like it we have fun with it right we have fun but it's a phony deal many of these people i would say most of these people are told to come here and try and disrupt and agitate the bad people but we are so cool and we take care of myself and remember what i said is safest place on earth is a trump rally carrier for is building a two and a half billion dollar plan to have been talking about it for two years it's been my big baby and you know what that is and they're gonna make their cars and trucks and parts and they're gonna pull them right into the united states we get nothing now the other day i'm reading in the wall street journal that they decided to do more we're gonna do boards gonna be bigger than gonna make it bigger why don't we get out of it we get nothing look at this area look at the state of pennsylvania that i love they're ripping our business is out that taken off hard out there taking our jobs out and we're not going to let him get away with this system is rigged voting is rigged the whole deal is 200 almost as crooked as crooked hillary did deal and that's why you have a case where i go in and win with the vote and these guys going day by delegates say brian dinners they send the dog tells the whole thing is a sham and by the way i don't know even my enemies in the media agree with me and lots of changes are being made with all of that being said we're winning by a lot we're kickin ass and when i came down that escalated with melani i had two things are mine trade because we make the world trade deals probably at anytime anywhere china has done to our country we have a trade deficit with china a five hundred and five billion dollars a year then you have these stupid people that write magazines they call him the elite a relatively have a better plan than i do these early people these are late that means that we're not only that but i'm not only do i don't know i don't think anybody has ever do they have better than i felt the company and i filed all the papers at federal i borrowed a million dollars and i built it in my father gave me two hundred and fifty i waste my father gave me my father was tough and he was from brooklyn and he built houses in brooklyn and i borrow a million dollars and i built it into a company that's worth more than ten billion dollars with the greatest assets with the greatest assets some of the greatest assets in the world trade cash flow very little debt and i say it not to break and all i say it because that's the kind of thinking we need in this country at least for a while until we straighten out because we're sitting right now on a bubble on a big fat ugly bubble drugs it's gonna be ugly you think your business if that bubble explode and it's gonna happen unless i'm elected we are things that are gonna be so good and that's when i do we gotta get down the debt we're gonna do so many things but the big thing we have to do is we have to take care of our trade we can't allow china and to have us have a trade deficit of five hundred and five billion japan trade deficit they sell cars they give us cars cars come in we give them practically nothing the balances up here we send them big piece of beef or a car its imbalance we have all the cuts his a good we have the carts we have to piggy bank we're not gonna have the pity when i gotta have it for long because the money is being drained out of our system by other countries and because we have political action negotiating deals for us so that's going to all and mexico has a trade we have a trade deficit with mexico 58 billion dollars and that doesn't include the drugs across the border which probably who knows it's probably we are going to do things and when i get up at the defects and remember this i've been number one every single debate i've been centers where been center stage at every debate set all these politicians i was driving them crazy and then the debates if you look at drugs use an amazing guy if you look at all the balls the debate calls right after the debates every single debate every single poll which is nice i don't know if i could debate i never did that that's all politicians do they're all talk and no action and our country is going to hell and we could have stopped it and we're going to stop it fast so when we have a trade deficit with china five hundred and five billion dollars billion billion that means not so good that so good so what happens is we have these people there in magazines and they write they did terrible terrible people they don't know actually they might not even be maybe you know they call themselves i told you lately and they write they should all just gonna betrayed 101 when somebody is taken in five hundred and five billion would that we are let's have a trade i mean we can't keep going like this and here's the story we will get along better with china that we get along right now and what things and they won't be doing what they're doing right now right now they have perpetrated the single greatest theft in the history of the world they have robbed us flying a job other nations china's been the greatest abuser but so of other nations so when you gonna stop it and we are gonna bring jobs back and we're going to keep jobs here and there's gonna be a time in the very near future when apple computer i don't worry about him he's got no voice i can hear the guy he's got you know the biggest the cutest thing my people they see somebody's going nobody could hear that my people go there is there is nowhere to go but the police say they're already look at that guy policemen raise your hands i love you look at his guys look at these guys like a the great wall of china 2013 thousand miles we can tell me 1,000 miles and i love and i'm gonna get so many jobs for the african-american people that can't get jobs now and with it a new great in nevada where i want to stay they did a poll people leaving hispanics i was number one in the poll and easy number one and the news you put it they said we don't understand donald trump is number one with hispanics i love this vantage i can't help it that the leaders in mexico and every other country every other country that do business with us we like the dump only that keeps getting knocked down again i'm out good i said mexico's gonna pay for the wall these same jus guys walk up to me they say mexico's never gonna pay for the wall i said why not if we are having a trade deficit of fifty eight billion a year and the walls gonna cost ten billion dollars that's one of the easiest negotiations i've seen and then they had the former president vincent say fox the former president of mexico he's being interviewed by one of the big cable networks and he said we won't pay for the and that he used the f bomb and i said all is he in trouble tomorrow it's gonna be headlines he used the f bomb on live television right he used the f bomb and i said could you imagine by the way trucks if i ever use the f bomb i think i get the electric chair do you agree ok this guy nobody talks about his what he said when they gonna pay for the you know wat wall on live television and the anger was stolen and you know i was angry how dare somebody tell them to do something because for years and every other country has been ripping us off and then that uses somebody saying listen we're building a wall and you are paying for it because you are sending a lot of people over and you've given us a lot of headaches and you're gonna pay for that wall at that wall is peanuts compared to the kind of money you make gone even waste your breath i love but don't even wait it's so easy that's almost as telling you about his day or you got problems ok you better say are you got problems remember that five years thinking about what can we do let's give an incentive let's give them financing come in packs to do anything but they don't want to do it they don't want to do it because this stupid because they're really or corrupt in a sense they're corrupt so here's the story so fox said no way there is no way now i actually liked it because two years ago he's just a there is no way we will allow a wall to be built he obviously understands what's going to happen now he doesn't talk about that now just believe me mexico's paying for the wall ok you know i want to do hampshire and is a beautiful state of beautiful area and it was my first victory now have won 23 24 states i'm getting spoiled i gotta win pennsylvania that's when i wanna win pennsylvania i mean cruise doesn't even know where he does this guy he went to new york and they threw him around like a rag doll i love when i watch him come in second to kasich i just love it i love it it's so cool i look we're all fold up back there i hope you people are you ok i mean i feel badly for the people they got to hear about 2 percent of what we've been talking about on that but look look so we are going to get all of these things done you've gotta get out involved you've really got to put a pic you gotta get your friends you've gotta get everybody you know few days some amazing how time flies it feels like i won new york yesterday it's already like three days and i what it really does they really don't be well in new york in this series they know very well what really is nice is the people that really know me people that know the person when they vote for the person and you get even 10 points higher than the polls were saying you were gonna get that being said i love you i get 61 remember there were also a great jeffrey lord can tell you this but they were all saying jeffrey if he can break fifty it'll be a great victory is that right but nobody i got 61 more than 60 once i is a start and almost all of the delegates gotta go out of it on tuesday because we have a movement going on we have a movement that's been on the

trains number one source for all things drop keep in contact with donald trump watching the right side broadcast network learning all you can about the number one candidate to become president of the united states donald j trop subscribe and stay connected and learn all things from the right side next president of the united i have to tell you that the fire marshal they turned away thousands of people they turned away that thank you very much they turned away thousands of people look at the size of this place they turned away thousand they were given orders that no more than a thousand people now hillary clinton i have a picture here which is pretty said she had she had last week or a couple of days ago look at all a totally empty but is the marriage emma-crats is the democrat on the what i heard you got to be ashamed of himself they turned away thousands of people but that makes it better for you right not it's very said you know shouldn't be so much about politics folks well we're going to a town hall so we're going to be talking about questions and this and that i'll say a few words but outside i met two gentlemen from piketon who really were misrepresented very badly very badly by president obama and they're going to come up come on up fellas i just met him come on up because we're gonna bring back our jobs we're not going to let our jobs go to mexico and all these other countries we're going to renegotiate the horrible nafta deal which is maybe the worst deal ever made from an economic development standpoint and i'm not just talking in this country i'm talking about in the world we're going to bring back our jobs and we're also we're also going to stop radical islamic terrorism when not letting the people come in we're not letting them come in and they can play all the games they want but we're not you know hillary clinton wants a five hundred and fifty percent increase from syria coming into this country over obama and you'd actually say what is she doing so here's a letter from president obama to these two gentlemen that have worked so hard and are having a hard time and maybe in just a little while you could just say exactly what's going on my name is jeff fall break i'm from portsmouth ohio we have a plant just north of portsmouth in piketon that enriched uranium and for seven years evan and i have been going to washington and talking to politicians about saving the plant that enriched uranium there were hundreds of jobs there and it's the only it was the only plant in the united states that enriched uranium but i also have the hotel the holiday inn in portsmouth and then senator barack obama who is running for president came and stayed at my hotel and he said i'm going to get up at five o'clock in the morning and i need breakfast but you're not open yet i says all right two things you have to promise me something and you have to get your picture taken with me so i fixed him six eggs six strips of bacon a big pile of home-fried potatoes for whole wheat toast and a big bowl of oatmeal and i asked him how do you eat all it only male get today so he had his picture taken with me lived up to that promise and then i said we have this plant and piped in that we want to continue enriching uranium lots of employees we need the government help and we also need the old site cleaned up how do you feel about that project in piketon and the man looked me in the eye he says i support the pipe then project so i want to thank donald trump he's here in ohio and and i i don't know him personally but i feel like he's the man that if he says i'm going to do something i'm gonna do it so let's all support donald trump heaven go ahead the only thing i've got to know one thing i've got to say is when these politicians make promises which has been promised to us that somebody hold them accountable thank you both very much same old stuff politicians all talk no action won't happen and you know hilary will be nothing more than four more years of obama four more years of isis four more years of a military that's being depleted and not taking care of our vets she said a few months ago our vets are being taken care of just fine she said no no it's over exaggerated i know the vets i think i have tremendous support with events raised a lot of money and gave a lot of money to the vets i will tell you something the vets are not being taken care of well at all the suicide rate is hard to believe even when you hear the numbers and you know the numbers i'm talking about they wait in line for two three four five days thinking of going to a doctor and waiting for five days longer than that and people are dying waiting on line so we're going to take care of our vets we're going to again secure and very important we're going to secure our borders we're going to secure our borders yeah yeah yeah printable well we're going to build the wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall and the reason some of the politicians have said you know they're not going to pass it no no you don't understand they're gonna pay they are making so much money mexico they're taking our business a friend of mine bills plants that's what he does plants if you had a building apartment he wouldn't know where to begin but he builds massive plants among the biggest in the world and i said to him recently how are you doing he said unbelievable now he's from this country and they'd like to do well in this country but i said how are you doing he said unbelievable i said that's good so you're doing a lot of work in the united states not so much said well how are you doing unbelievably you wouldn't believe what's happening in mexico it's the eighth wonder in the world that's what he told me i so what does that mean he said they're building among the biggest plants we've ever built it's unbelievable companies are moving out of the united states columbus by the way they're moving out of the united states they're moving out of ohio is them they're moving out of michigan big-league the cars he bills car plans he bills computer plans because them all and they're moving out of the united states so i said well how's the united states doing he says not so good he said but mexico is the eighth wonder of the world that's going to end folks we want mexico to do fine but we're not going to let him take our jobs anymore we're not going to let it happen you look at this area i mean i have statisticians right good statisticians they love to do this i can't imagine doing it being too much fun to me it would be a little bit boring to do but i'll tell you the numbers are horrendous first of all i don't know if you just saw the number for growth of our country do you see that growth one-point-two percent one-point-two percent we're sinking we're sinking that's one of the lowest numbers ever i think it's the lowest number ever in terms of trying to make a comeback one-point-two percent but in columbus and i look at this and this is bad this is bad ohio is lost one in three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton side nafta built let inside it and hillary clinton wants think of that hillary clinton's disastrous trade policies are responsible for the manufacturing job losses in ohio and throughout the other states yeah i've got a machine and i'll tell you the problem with the machine it totally controls the press you look at cnn it's called the clinton news network all day long tromp tromp all day long cnn throb throb throb such a bad guy i just want to bring back your jobs i want to bring back your safety because we're not safe five hundred and fifty percent more people coming in from syria and other territories and we have no idea who they are and i've got to the best law enforcement officials and they said there's no way of you telling that they have all sorts of false things you know they stole our passport machine you saw that they make passports better than we do ok they have think of it five hundred and fifty percent more than obama and he's letting in thousands and thousands of people the people in ohio the people in the rust belt and they called the rust belt for a reason because everything is rusting and writing you lost your jobs they're moving to mexico remember my friend with the plant when you get a vote remember this november eight when you go to vote remember my friend with the plant where he says it's the eighth wonder of the world and we're gonna read a goat if you want unless you don't want to do this we're going to renegotiate nafta and it was very it was very funny the other day i saw hillary clinton saying first time ever we are going to start renegotiating our trade deals that's been me for years that's been me number one she won't do a good job of it for a lot of reasons but one of them is that she's totally controlled by the special interests and you know like i'll give you an example i just saw this number just read it coming up here donald trump has raised nineteen thousand dollars from hedge funds now i don't know how it got in there i don't even want it because send it back hillary clinton from hedge funds has raised 48.5 million pickle 48.5 million dollars i hope you don't i have a friend is very wealthy he doesn't on a hedge fund good but ray's 48.5 million i have 19,000 i think i'll send the 19,000 back probably a nice person but think of it but here is really what's important to me so i funded as you know my primary people are very happy i'm continuing to fund my general election but we're also taking small donations which in the primary wasn't a big factor because we didn't really we sold hats and things little things that was cute and people like it and people put in small money but i funded it and i guess i'm into everything for 60 million or over 60 million or soon will be over 60 million but i'm continuing to fund my campaign but we're also raising money from people when they send in a check small donors right you've sent to check who sent the check wow whoa that's fantastic so we only started last month and she's going to have like a fortune she's gonna have like a billion billion and a half because she's going to be totally controlled like we talked about uranium the two gentlemen great people well she had a lot to do with russian uranium you saw that deal and jack's got paid a fortune for allowing russia to come in talk about uranium that's big self ok got paid a fortune and we'll be talking about that during the campaign don't worry about it but so we started really around the middle of june and we had a tremendous soon and there was a donald trump didn't raise any what it wouldn't start we started in the middle of june and we raised i think was 27 million dollars from the small donor that was around 60 some odd dollars apiece and we also raise from other people about i don't know the total was about 51 million dollars okay that was until we hardly that was like for half a month because people want to see something happen with our country but here's what's really goodness this is just going to be reported i think today or tomorrow we have raised with the small donor 35.8 million dollars yeah i believe it's five hundred and seventeen thousand donors think of that that's in a month so we raise 35.8 million even a little more than that and the average price of the donation with $69 how incredible is that right and it's not even to me the money it's to me the concept in all fairness bernie sanders was doing that you know because there was a movement that was a movement on the other side of the plate but you know what he had one thing in common with me he knew that the trade deals are destroying our country the difference is he couldn't do anything about the trade deals i'll take those trade deals to make them so good that's what i do i love taking bad deals are making them good that's what i do i take bad deals and make them good napped is a bad bad bad deal and i'm going to make it good but think of that so we raised 35.8 million in excess of that in a month and then in addition we raised money that has been tabulated yet from people that are putting up larger numbers but that's going to the republican national largely to the republican national committee and i'm and i'm putting up money to run my campaign ok so when you see when you see that clinton crooked hillary crooked she's crooked as a three-dollar bill let me tell you she is crooked when you see crooked hillary with 40 8.5 million from hedge funds and trump at nineteen thousand dollars when they call me because they want to stop a company from doing something or when they call me because they want one of your companies to get the green light to move into mexico and fire everybody believe me i'm going to take care of these come i'm going to do what's right for you she's got to do right for her donors i'm going to do right for you so it's going to be a big difference going to be going to be a big so so i just tell you were battling a lot of things but we're battling the press because the press is very dishonest ok press is very discerning so so as an example as an example i gave a very good answer over the weekend to one of the shows on russia going into the ukraine i said very simply they're not gonna do it on my watch essentially i said russia will not go into the equation now said that and the next day the story comes out and we really let it roll a little bit actually i think it was usa today a couple of them covered it accurately what i said but a couple of paper said donald trump doesn't realize that the crimea was already taken i know an exact two years ago approximately ok approximately it was taken during obama's watch so when i said i believe me russia's not going into ukraine all right they're not going into ukraine the person said but they're already in ukraine i said yeah well that was two years ago thats that's i mean you want to go back you wanna have world war three to get it back that was during obama's watch so during obama's watch you know all the tough-guy sevens right so he talks about donald trump is not strong russian first of all i have to say this wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with russia am i wrong in saying that it'd be great ok you know russia like us has nuclear weapons folks it would be really nice if we got along with russia and others that we don't get along with right now and wouldn't it be nice if we teamed up with russia and others including surrounding states and maybe nato and we knocked the hell out of isis and got rid of these books but but but even beyond that even beyond putin said some very good things about me people say all trump's going to be week with putin because putin is saying nice things about me okay all right and i said he's a strong guy they immediately say all trump likes but look i don't like was just like i just say this way wouldn't it be great if the united states and russia got along combined knocked out isis maybe did other positive things you know we forced them through stupidity into an alliance with china you know why because of oil because china needs oil we were driving in both crazy they formed and from the time i was a young guy i've always learned don't ever let china and russia get together we force them together obama force them together because he didn't get along with either and they eventually china came in and said let's make it the other oil it together fact they're doing naval exercises together someplace and you look at china they're building one of the largest military installations in the world writes back in the middle of the south china sea and then they talk about donald trump and russia or donald trump but believe me folks somebody can say nice things about me he did call me a genius but these are minor detail somebody can say nice things about me has it makes no difference it makes no difference right i've been dealing a long time a lot of times i make much better deals with people that say terrible things about me i don't care what they say about me i want the deal you know what trade one of the people that standing back there one of the dishonest media well what's your definition of trade i said well you're fair trade you have also to have so many different types of trade but here's my definition of trade because right now we're being ripped off 500 billion dollar trade deficit with china 500 billion and they give us product we let him n no tax no nothing you want to try and make a deal with china you can't get your product in and if you do you pay tax and if you do you also have to build plants over there and they don't even want that they don't want you in there one side of deals so when they said what's your trade deal i said very simply i want to make great deals for the united states we don't have to name it you have a fair trade you have all sorts of names i learned every single one of them in college now we've added a couple is the problem we have stupid people doing are negotiating we have stupid people doing our negotiation i'll give you an example if a company in ohio said they're gonna leave we're going to fire which as you know many companies are leaving and by the way as you're sitting here right now right now we have companies negotiating with mexico and other places too close up in ohio and to move into mexico or other places ok as you're sitting here right now some of you people think you have good jobs guess what carrier thought they had good jobs for thought they had good jobs lots of hundreds and hundreds thousands of companies have left thousands millions of jobs and hillary clinton is weak and she's ineffective and there's no way you can allow for more years of this stuff to go on there's just no way in my opinion but let's say and by the way your steel mills in ohio where china's dumping steel to put you guys out of business they're dumping you know that who's in steel over here am i right they're dumping steel to put the steel workers out of business and hillary said the miners any minors in here - i love the miners all west virginia was good to me i'll tell you and ohio is good to me a lot of minors in ohio minor but hillary clinton said we're going to put the miners in the mindset of business now she said that before probably an environmental group or something but then she tried to back up but they remembered she said it and she got clobbered in west virginia smart people she got clobbered in west virginia ok so so we're gonna have clean call and we're gonna have steel and we're gonna make up products again and we're going to have the people in columbus and all of ohio and all of michigan and all of these other states and i did great in michigan i did great in ohio - unfortunately i didn't have a long time to campaign i would spend two more days here i would have won ohio - because i want practically everything else we got we got almost 14 million votes think of that more than anybody in the history of republican primers that influenced some great people like ronald reagan dwight d eisenhower who won the second world war right he did win the second world walk got elected because they won the second world war i got more votes in him that's good right and remember this i had 17 people i didn't i wasn't running against two people at 17 people hillary clinton i got a similar number to hillary clinton and she had burning and she had a hard time putting bernie away and burning for burning he looks so upset he you know what he made a mistake he shouldn't have made a deal sometimes he lost he lost first was rigged and i'm afraid the election is going to be rick i have to be honest because i think my side was rigged if i didn't win by massive landslides i mean think of what we want to new york and indiana california seventy-eight percent that's with other people in the in the race but think of it i hear more and more that the election or not november eighth can you believe we're almost there this started on june sixteenth of last year and i said wow let's go do it takes guts to do this believe me and everybody said now it takes guts i could be having a very nice life right now i don't have to be with you people ranting and raving right could have a very nice like but it takes guts and everybody said this is the greatest field i remember charles krauthammer saying this is the greatest field ever assembled in the history of republican politics or something to that effect this is before i got in and i said to my wife you know it's a great field charles krauthammer and others are saying this is the greatest field ever assembled it's also the largest field ever assembled so i have the greatest largest field of resemble and then one day i just i had it i watch the iran deal this horrible deal be done where we give back a hundred and fifty billion dollars and they're making nuclear weapons and we've made a power out of around they were struggling for their life and we've made a power out of around fact they were in serious trouble when they were all marching in the streets it was over and obama came to their rescue if you remember that first term that was a bad day that was going to be over for them and we came to their rescue now we've made him into a power ok a big power but i saw the iran deal and i saw the stupidity on trade where companies are leaving one of them was carrier left indiana 1,400 people fired moving to indiana going to make their plant they're going to build it they're going to take their air conditioners make them sell them right back into indiana and other places no tax no nothing with me they're going to be taxed 35% and you know what they're never gonna move there never moving fault then never moving okay then never moving did you ever see because i love this life you know i've been look you know people say not a politician remember when they said a certain person well he got clobbered raise tremendous amounts of money and everybody thought he do really well but they say but he hasn't been an active politician for eight years i've never been a politician and we won in a landslide so but i don't get credit for that they don't give me credit what are you going to get you know i was joking i was joking because some people thought it was a little bit too tough and i have been certain people that i ran against the republican primaries have never come back and they probably won't and that's okay i do better when they don't come back i do better if i have missed my opponent is a as opposed to my ally no no but we have a few you know the names we have a few they haven't come back they haven't come back i tell you i was honored at the convention for two reasons number one i had 35 million people watching hillary had why 28 million people this final speech so we had more people watching depressed built up that convention like it was the greatest a democrat can i actually thought i like the republican convention i would rather watch yeah i would rather watch ivanka trump yeah then any of their celebrities i can tell you i would rather watch john and eric and tiffany and milania did a great job i would rather watch them than any of their celebrities you know they all said well donald trump and his kids with that nice if you have kids at a capable enough to go up and do you know why people haven't had their kids go up because they kids can't do it and i can understand that that's a hard thing to do my kids went up there were brave they were strong tiffany we push her out on the stage go and she never did appeal tiffany said this is really scary and we just said just go to it she did beautifully she never spoke to anybody throw the biggest groups has ever spoken to is like 18 people in its last where she was a very good student i have to say but but you know they did a great job but i actually like the republican national convention better i'll tell you what we had a much better looking stage number one which is important we want fish that but we got a very unfair press when bernie sanders had his people leaving the room nobody covered that if i would have had people leave the room would have been a national scandal when a certain man got up that and i knew his speech i said look let him speak what difference does it make and he says certain man got up and he spoke and everybody in the room blew the hell out of them fact i saved his life when i walked back into the room but everybody of their own and his numbers went down like from 68 to 20 something that's called unity folks that's unity that's a good thing not a bad thing that is unity and but the problem we have the biggest problem we have i think is the press the new york times is totally dishonest totally dishonest the washington post gotten a little bit better lately i took away their press credentials i should do it with the times but the problem is you get more publicity from good just let him rot but the new york times is really really dishonest and it's failing i don't think they'll be in business for the door three years look at their numbers their failing but they do a number that's unbelievable every story is better in fact sometimes i'll say off great this was so good i'm gonna have a great story tomorrow in the new york times you know they'll call always turned out to be a disaster they it's so dishonest and yet hilary hilary crooked hillary they write beautifully about right washington post similar it was really bad now it's gotten a little bit better i must tell you so watch the post got a little bit better cnn is so dishonest clinton news network so dishonest unbelievable you know what they call it it may be the clinton news network but nobody wants to watch hillary all day long it's trump all day all the time that's what it but it's all its so much inaccurate information and by the way i think their ratings are going to go down really sharply now they've been asking me to go on for much i won't do this yes and the reason i won't is because it's so dishonest that until they straight up i'm not doing their shows and when people finally realized that i'm not doing their jobs they stopped watching that's what happened and i much that i don't say this for a reason and they're tough they're very tough on me but fox has at least been fair they've been fair fox has been triggered so at some point at some point we're just going to keep barreling through people asked me to run people ask me later on at real donald trump and letters and everything you know we have twenty two and a half million people between twitter and can you believe it you know i have a lot of people they say don't use twitter anymore why i got 22 million people between that and facebook and instagram and i'm a very modern person in a way right but thank you it you know who says don't use twitter your enemies or people why wouldn't i use it why would if i have all these millions of people and it's a great way to get a message out so when they write falsely or say something totally false on the today show or good morning america i put out a tweet and you see all over television we have breaking news and i may be tweeting from bed ok a little stroke is instantaneous if i put out a beautiful long perfectly scripted press release like i did yesterday nobody puts it out if i put out like a 140-character tweet they go crazy we have breaking news they break into every story so so you gotta use you got it well here's the story so i'm going i love ohio i've been here working out of you know i worked in cincinnati for a period of time i had great success it was one of my first jobs i did it with my father was called swift and village and we bought something that was a disaster it was empty and had 11 hundred and fifty four units it was a total disaster and we bought it from hud and turned it around i was here i did a great job gave me great confidence because it's good to hit with a good job and then we sold it at a at a great for tremendous profit and we want her to the next and i loved cincinnati and interesting like after i sold it the job went very bad the job was very bit i mean it when my timing was very good and i listened to people but i really listen to myself and the timing was beautiful we had it for a number of years but we sold it fact from the day i sold it to the day we close contract was bought by a reek one of the early roots it lost a lot of its occupants that's how the timing was like perfect timing and i just think of since i the queen city i love cincinnati i love kentucky i you not go to kentucky for fun i won't tell you what can you imagine that story if they find out about that but i love kentucky and kentucky likes me but it i do well in kentucky kentucky we love kentucky and we're going to take care of the miners in kentucky believe me we're going to take care of the miners in casa but i had a great time in cincinnati and i had a great time in ohio the people of ohio are special people and they're smart people and they know when it's happening to him they know great things are going to happen we are going to turn this state into a manufacturing behemoth we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to bring your company's back we're gonna bring companies that left are going to come back because it will no longer be economic for them to continue where they are we're going to bring companies back we're going to bring companies back you know i tell this one story that you heard about with carrier in indiana which i wanted a landslide that was supposed to be the firewall remember indiana will be his firewall they said new york we expect them to win pennsylvania we expect them to win one maryland rhode island delaware we want about we expect a little but indiana is going to be the firewall right and then bobby knight called and bobby knight how bout bobby knight i we love bobby no winner he's a winner bobby knight and he came out you know nine hundred games three national championships last undefeated college team won the olympics one the pan am games other than that that's good coach right we love bobby knight and what a job and what a tough cookie and he said to me i hope you're going to run for president is before i know what we call me you should run for president you'll be great i said bobby i haven't decided this was before june sixteenth few months i haven't decided so just run and then when i ran i call them and he said i've been waiting for you to call and we went to indiana and it was incredible but the thing that happened that i've been talking about for a year and it happened to be in indiana was when carrier air conditioned fired a hundred and 1400 people right they fired 1,400 people like like dogs like dogs may fire it's on tape had i not seen it on tape on television it would have had the impact that head these are people that have worked there some of them for more than 30 years and they would follow me around all over indiana i don't have the people from care so let me just tell you if i were negotiating and let's say i heard they were going to close and if i said folks want to meet with you was your president they said the president said let me tell you you're leaving 1400 great people now if you want to stay within the united states that's a different deal the states will compete against themselves right but you want to move to mexico you want to build a plant i wish you luck but if you do that you're going to pay this thirty-five percent tax here's what's going to happen from but here's what's gonna happen so simple they're not gonna leave they're not gonna leave because it doesn't work economically for them to leave so now they're not going to leave and if they do leave that's okay too because we're gonna make a fortune ok we're going to make a fortune now i've been watching this country for seven or eight or nine years even before obama working on plans to stop people and companies from leaving the united states i've seen low-interest loans i've seen zero interest i've seen it all i've seen it all i've seen every plan you can imagine i've seen where they give them money they substitute they do everything a lot of these companies don't need money they just want to make more but you know what my plan which is so simple we don't need anything nice and simple and when i say that to the company if you're running a company you in the blue and you're running a company and i save you if you leave ohio i wish you a lot of luck enjoy the warm climate in mexico but if you leave of ohio you're not gonna make your product and sell it back into ohio where you have all these unemployed people what's going to happen is you're gonna have a tax to pay to get the product back in and when you hear that you're not going to be very fast so if you could actually leave ok almost a hundred percent you're not going to leave it is not going to work because the economics of work anymore and when my friend talks about it's the eighth wonder of the world mexico i think that's great i respect mexico i love the mexican people have thousands of mexican people that have worked for me over the years thousands and thousands a great but their leaders are too smart for our leaders ok and they're stripping our country and they're stripping ohio so hillary clinton doesn't talk this way hilary gets up and she reads her teleprompter we are going to build new roads we are going to build new schools we are going to go we're going to build and just like the two gentlemen that came up here you'll be let down a hundred percent but me this is my thing i've been talking about this for years you know somebody said you know it's amazing comfortable talking about this for 20 years it used to be japan remember when i talked about japan now it's china but it's still japan japan made a fortune devaluing their currency china makes a fortune with currency manipulation it's cheating it's cheating and when i sit down and say listen you got to stop this you're killing us you got 500 billion dollar trade deficits for us you got to stop it we have rebuilt china and when i tell them this and when i say listen we gotta do it you gotta do it see we have all the power but nobody knows it and when we catch him cheating ten percent tax rate across the board every good coming in from china right now here's what's gonna happen number one they're going to stop cheating and if they don't we collect ten percent we make a fortune but they got to stop cheating there's nobody that tells them this when they come over president obama they put a tent on the white house lawn right and they give my state dinner like you've never seen before although i would have a ballroom i offered to build a ballroom you know that sort they turned it down i was gonna i was going to put up a hundred million dollars to build a ballroom at the white house because having a tent is not that good it's not even that safe canvas tent and then everything got back to me that's the way it is if i were president somebody offered that i'd say give me the top five american architects in the united states get them over here all of you come up with the ball room that holds a thousand people 1,000 people and they'll come up and one of them will be beautiful and we'll build it i'll take the guys money believe me i promise somebody wants to build a ballroom at the white house they turned me down no interest no interest because that's the way the country roads so i'm always saying to the people of ohio to the people of columbus i want to tell you we're going to turn this country around and we're going to make it so strong and so great and we're going to run it smart we're not going to run its stupid like it is you're not going to have when i look at your numbers one when my statistician writes all the stuff out it's just one bed number after another it's a terrible i mean honestly it's a terrible thing look columbus columbus ohio is lost one and three manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed nafta right columbus has lost one in for manufacturing jobs since bill clinton signed an agreement to put china into the world trade organization right hilary ram through the job-killing trade deal with south korea that's for the killer to deal with south korea's been a killer i'd by thousands of television sets thousands and thousands that nobody makes television set remember we used to have sylvania for those of us that are old enough we had general electric we had all these companies we got nobody we don't make television sets when i may get it we don't make a lot soon we won't make anything sooner and you can only have so many nursing homes in a factory you know a lot of factories were taken they were made into nursing homes i think that's great but you can only have so many that we need jobs we need jobs look at it is i've been abandoned the diplomatic personnel it is so many different things supports i told you this support to five hundred and fifty percent increase was sort of amazing because the president say well you're wrong and you exaggerated that number no matter if you said to into a for they will get these super liberal groups to say well he's not really right it's not really for you know when i read off the crime statistics about the police that are being shot like in dallas and other places and i read about it and i said we had a fifty percent increase in police shooting and they said well yeah but that was only for this year but if you go over 10 years or 12 years or if you go over seven point three years there's a little bit less look folks the country is a mess we're gonna make it strong again we're going to make it safe again you're going to be so proud of you gonna be so proud of it and you're going to be proud of your president but more importantly you going to be proud of your country okay so why don't we take a few questions and when we're finished with the questions let's go back to work and those of you that don't have work hang in there jobs will be back sooner than you think ok believe yeah go ahead hello hi my name is the white flags for mana hai and four years we've been told by the obamacare supporters that the law is working because it has increased healthcare coverage for everybody and also that the health care spending growth has you know gone down right but it's not true because the sea you know the cbo and then and right cms has told us the truth my question for you is what are you going to do to repeal obama okay great what's your plan they can't be a better question other than our defense okay because we're going to build up are depleted military most important defense is always number one don't you think but we're going to build our trip later we're going to take care of our vets ok obamacare number one we're going to repeal it and replace it 100 percent is a total disaster you so what's happening in texas blue cross blue shield working through obamacare sixty percent increase here's the thing you don't nobody notices the numbers are so bad on obamacare so bad that our november first they're going to be announced those numbers are presidential election changing numbers those numbers are going to be so high beyond anything we've had and president obama is trying to change the date to december first because when people see what's going to happen to obamacare and to your healthcare numbers there's so esther na macol that people will never vote for crooked hillary clinton never gonna vote for so and and and you asked a very interesting question the way you phrased it was very interested because you have a lot of part-time workers now that never had a part-time job in their life you have people in this room don't raise your heads but you have people in this room that are making less money now then they made 18 years ago in real wages less money and in some cases they're making less money and working two jobs and that's largely because of obamacare because companies save money by breaking it up so they'll take full time beautiful employees that have worked for companies for years and those am sorry you're going to be a part-time employee from knowing obamacare has been a disaster obamacare is so unfair and you know you had a lot of people that had good plans and we have to take care of people the can't that don't have the money to take care of themselves you look like a rich guy okay least modestly rich i think could be very rich but we have to take care of people that can't afford and i'm all for that and we have something coming i think that's going to be great and a lot of republicans would say that's not republican let me tell you it is republican folks you know every time i've ever said it i've never had anybody other than the egg kids you know the people that said trump is never going to run and he runs i don't think he'll do very well we go to six we got 12 12 24 we gotta stick by me forget it but you know what other than the so-called eggheads we never and i mean this i've never had anybody in the audience when i said we're gonna have a great plan we're getting rid of the boundaries we're gonna have great private competition and you're gonna have plans now that we can't even talk about because these companies will come up with plants and it's going to be so much less expensive and so much better and for the people that can't afford that we're going to take care of them and i tell you what i've never had one person and i have the biggest crowds of anybody i've never had one person stand up and say that's not republican except for the a can't say so you can't do that we got to take care of people we can't have people dying in the streets we can't have our vets as an example dying waiting on line because they can't get to see a doctor and with our vet interestingly but with our vets when you have these massive weights we're going to have our vets go to the local doctors or the local hospital private or public take care of themselves they're not going to be committed suicide many are committing suicide because of the weights they can't stand it they can't stand the pain simple procedures can save their life simple procedures a little incision a small operation a pill a pill can save their lives and their dying waiting for a doctor and we're gonna end my plan is filed policy we're going to have people they can't get in there going to go they're going to see a local doctor going to see a local hospital public or private we're going to pay for the bill and by the way that's number one from a humanitarian standpoint that's great and even even less importantly because ultimately we got to say people it's going to be less expensive and we're not going to have the problems that we have where people are committing suicide so many people every day that's a committing suicide because they can't even get to see the doctor to help them to one of the big reasons of vet suicide so we're going to take care of that and we're going to take care of the above we're going to repeal replace we're gonna take care of everybody okay thank you good question ok yes go ahead i mr. trump yes my name is ryan rivers my business owner president obama has made thousands of regulations that have heard small business as president what will you do to help small businesses well it's really a great question ryan because the thing that may be surprised me the most is to me taxes are very important for taxes and to such a big cost or can be a big cost now we have a tax bill we have a tax law that's very complicated but it's a because if you would have told me going around and i've met so many small business owners and so many large business owners that if they had their choice between bringing our taxes down now i have the largest tax decrease of anybody that's run for office larry cudlow loves it a lot of people love it but it's the largest tax decrease of any person running for office from the beginning republican or democrat ok hilary is going to have to double taxes gonna have to double your taxes hillary clinton will double your taxes we're bringing it down to fifteen percent we're simplifying the system people that are making very little going to pay nothing until they can break into the system and you'll save a lot of money bureaucratically that way but people that are making very little going to pay nothing instead of sending in complicated returns and paying nothing but we have a very beautiful plan very simple very simple and very important but if you would have told me after speaking with thousands of people that regulations if they had their choice you can have either reduce regulation because people can open businesses they can run their businesses you can either have lower taxes or reduce regulation people would take the regulation that surprised me that's how bad regulations are you look at the energy business the energy business is being put out of business speak put out of business many small business owners have come up to me saying mr. trump i'm gonna lose my businesses are regulations so we're gonna we're gonna take care we're going to cut down the regulations i would bet between 85 and 90 percent ok now some unnecessary you know for safety but some are necessary but i'll bet we can cut every year there but you must be a cottage industry there are people that just write regulations all day long we're going to cut down regulations between 85 and 90 percent we're going to take care of the environment we're going to take care of safety but we're going to let it be that we're going to be a growing growing when you look at one point two percent that said our record that means we're drowning means we're drowning is where we're going in the opposite direction so we're going to take care of regulations we're gonna have a very very big cuts and regulations ok another question who's got the mic who's got go ahead yes hi good afternoon mr. trump hi my name is i don't run aground taurus i have 16 years old and i'm from puerto rica good i think you know her on a herring heroin yeah it's an epidemic here in a higher my question is we you please will you please cut off the source yeah i will cut off the source build the wall i will cut off this yep good question very well as thank you very much a heroine so my first victory as a candidate number one was new hampshire which is a beautiful beautiful place beautiful trees beautiful meadows beautiful little roads and i got to know the people of new hampshire very well and i did i'm believe we won in a landslide in new hampshire that was at the beginning when we had all these people competing it's a great state and they have unbelievable people i get to know the people and i go into meetings i say so what's your biggest problem and they would always say heroin heroin i said what i mean heroin they say heroin i said this doesn't look like it's a heroine like problem type place they say mr. trump it is flowing across our southern border it's cheaper than candy our kids are being poisoned they're being addicted not only kids but kids they're being addicted they're dying and for some reason new hampshire more than any other place talks about that's why i'm so glad you asked that question but heroin so i said so where do you think it comes what's the source the source is the southern border comes from the southern border i said let me tell you if i win i'm going to stop it i'm going to stop it now we had 16,500 border patrol agents who are unbelievable people who if they didn't endorse we would have a much easier job because all they have to do is stand there people walk right through him right with me they're gonna stop people from coming into our country ok they're going to stop them and they're not gonna have to work that hard because the wall i asked him how important is the wall they said very important very important but so new hampshire told me about heroin and i said wow and i said if i win i'm going to stop heroin from coming in to this country and they're going to be big repercussions and i'm going to get the government of mexico and other governments to stop it or they've got problems with all the money we give them they'd better take better care they're not taking care of us they're not taking care of us you know i talked about trade deficits we have a massive trade deficit with mexico that doesn't include the drugs that are coming across we get the drugs they get the money like this big vans coming across drugs coming in money gone out those days are over folks those days are over so so so i i won new hampshire i then went down to all different places we did great in massachusetts home of tom brady we love tom brady but we did great in massachusetts we did great sort of everywhere but i see what a huge problem it's not just in new hampshire it's all over the place heroin is all over the place mothers and fathers are losing their children and heroin is a very addictive thing it's very hard to get out of that addiction of heroin it's very very hard and that's the other thing we're going to do we're going to take all of these kids and people not just kids that are totally addicted and they can't break it we're going to work with him we're going to spend the money we're going to get that habit broken but we're not going to let this crap come into our country and poison our youth and poison our people and it comes in mostly from the southern border and hillary clinton isn't going to do that number one she's not strong enough to do it you wouldn't have a clue so ladies and gentlemen thank you very much november eight you gotta go i'll be back i'll be back so much you'll be sick of me but november eight you have to go and vote we've got to win this election this is a big one ohio is a very important state we have to go we have to win this election i love you all thank you thank you very much everything thank you thank you yeah why wow this is incredible this is a better but this whole experience has been amazing i just want to thank everybody we've had an interesting couple of days i have to tell you but the crowds you know we were in dayton just a little while ago and the whole thing it's been so unbelievable it's been so unbelievable that the kind of crowds we've had have been you know their record-setting wow look at all these people look at all that crash we love you love you love you but then i wouldn't be legit cause i know it is bizarre and we liked it so so thank you thank you all for being here so we have a big big day coming up on tuesday and i think that it's going to be hopefully record-setting they're talking about what's happening all over all over the world they're talking about it and it's been it has been such an honor what they're talking about it as a movement we're going to take our country back we're gonna make america great and we're gonna beat hillary clinton i assume it's gonna be her very badly and we haven't even started and that one yet but we're going to be a very badly in we've gotta do it otherwise we're all wasting time folks ok and we don't want to waste time we don't want to waste time i will say this look i'm self funding my campaign putting up my own money you know these other guys are all subject to whatever the people that put up the money whether it's a fact they're all subject to these people they put up the money but leave me that's the people that listen do i call them the bosses they are the bosses so with me you're the boss and that's the way we're gonna so we we made some stops and we made some speeches today we had incredible crowds we had incredible crowds we went to cleveland we had twenty-seven thousand people in cleveland and we went to date and we had twenty thousand we we had it in a hanger and i didn't have to get out too much i walked out the plane was unbelievable a massive hangover packed the people came forward and something interesting happened did you hear about what happened not so good not-so-good he just said won't happen here who knows you gotta be careful we need strong courts we need strong laws you know we're not playing on the same field so i talked about that or not to talk about what happened she that's a nice thing about not using teleprompters and not reading speeches which would be so much is you who would that be nice you get up you read his speech you read his speech you leave 25 minutes later next no good right that's something by doing it the way i do it number one does a lot more enthusiasm there's a lot more energy to quote jeb bush but a lot a lot more energy and you can talk about things that happened twenty five minutes ago you know when you're writing up speeches you can't do that someday i'll read speeches but i really don't like doing it as much but i do have something i'm gonna read which i think is gonna find interesting so i was in dayton was an amazing experience we had great crowds we had a great group of people who sounds like you have a couple of protesters is that either their protests is a great chance right but but in dayton is going well the crowd was really well behaved because as you know in chicago we had a real problem i get him out here in about get him out support is i think it bernie support and a little bit less hillary you know hillary was saying donald trump has to stop the rhetoric he has to stop it and my people are great as these people that are the problem support is not tell you what though the police is so great thank you police we love our polish love our poll they do such a great job they do such a great job so anyway so yesterday in chicago the larger long gone dammam dammam he gone look at those cameras the way they've been around they'll do anything for a shot that's why i love the protest is the only way we find out how many people are in these places is through the protesters so i love our protesters and we don't want to hurt the protesters blaze with the protesters saw his history in chicago in chicago we had an interesting day we had 25,000 people replying they all wanted to be there fortunately we could call and we could get them what happened is we had very professional and very professionally organized the signs were made quiet this signs the signs were professionally made bernie have to check it's probably the same location again about get him out you know it's really amazing you know when you think about it you see this justice raptors bad people so bad for our country so bad for our country people have no idea what's going on so so do we have a good time at trump rallies this is happening unbelievable now here's another one is another beauty get about burning burning it's another birdie sign get outta here bernie get a deer bertie as another bernie's get around here out that's it bernie supporter folks get the bernie sign when you put in here by guarantee dinner out dinner out where these people coming from unbelievable where they coming from any other protesters in the room and the other they wear out they get tired after a while they get tired that was a burning she had a birdie sign a big professionally made bernie sign in his friend is running a lot of water so those are bernie signs right off the printing press and they put him in he's not doing so well in a way i guess it's going to be her but we'll see you go ahead take care of them get outta here you know if we do that to one of their rallies you know what happens front page how bad we are ok drug bank we do that to one of their rallies to birdie hillary and they would say isn't that terrible the press the designers press they've said they're the most dishonest people in the world they would say is that i get her out you notice they're all saying those are all saying supposing this happen it really wouldn't be the same thing that we agree wouldn't be quite the same ok let's go come on lads we just sit down look everyone so excited you want to sit down i love you ok i gotta watch after a few minutes another one will pop up and will be a burning person i love to run against bernie jury member a way to remember when the two young women came up and took away his microphone and he went to the back like a little that took away my mom that doesn't happen to us folks that doesn't happen we were in chicago yesterday and it was amazing with 25,000 people coming and we had disruption did disruptors that's all they are disruptors and they really came you had people not a lot of people that you'd like but you know what i sort of 10 like everybody but these were absolute disrupters and rather than go through the whole process i did want to see wherein anybody in a rush where no rush we're in no rush to get him out he had about cameras they're shooting is that nice get him out get him out get him out what his place is packed you know we have thousands of people outside trying to get in and these people have taken their place is not worth it we have thousands tried to get in i get them out anybody else that's a lot of people up there thank you everybody thank you unbelievable unbelievable what we have to put up with what we have to put up with you and me and all of us trying to make this country great again and it's really hard with people like this something you know when you think about it we want a strong military we want protection we wanted to take care of our vet sake of it we want to we want a good home we want a great family we want education we want great health care we want to watch some argue with right we're looking for the same thing as damn as anybody else watch the point in doing what they do disruptors said just raptors and let me tell you the reason they're doing it is because there's never been anything like this has happened before because you know what we did it take our country back from these people we're gonna take it back and we're gonna take our country country back from those people those people they do nothing they do not think we're gonna bring it back and we're gonna make america great again we're gonna make it great again and you know they're treated very gently very very gently i told the police i knew there was gonna be problems here they said why don't you can sign said no we're not canceling this time and i told the police you have weak people and they're going to protest and they gonna stand up as individuals because they don't have enough to do it as a group and they going to stand up be very gentle when you take them out very very gentle alright i just the police are doing that ok they all out so far any new ones when his stand-up anybody else want to stand up i'll tell you wat if there is nothing so interesting as a trump rally right we are going to have and i'll stand up all night and will do this all night and you know what it's addressing cause we have thousands of people outside wanna come in so i know you probably have a few more dell stand up in the middle of a point they always pick the right time oh he's a good point he wants to make a stand up almost we're better off if we don't say anything because you hear that little weak voice up there that's a protester that's a protest is actually when all of the room goes there whereas that voice you can't even hear it is pathetic but yesterday in chicago 25,000 people coming we're gonna have 15,000 outside we had speakers set up 10,000 inside and we had disruptors i call up not protesters i call them disruptors they had all professionally made signs they called him up it says burning on a burning candle burning you know he's a lousy senator for a long time all of a sudden he runs he didn't do a damn thing in the senate and you have hillary have some hillary's signs up at hillary frankly let's face it you look at what's going on in the primaries you look down 35 percent is no excitement whatsoever the republicans you know wat we are so far millions and millions of people is showing up at the polls to vote thank you and it's for me it's it's not it's not belittle marco and it's not fair lion dead ok not to lie in the biggest liar this is the biggest liar i've ever seen in my life it's not from marco it's not dead and it's a great honor i want to tell you it is a great great honour what's going on i get them at get him out these paper and then and then the audience gets rough with them and the press is how dare they how dare they try and try not to get too involved up there don't hurt the person doesn't hurt the person see i may not violent person did you know that about me non-violence try not to hurt the person thank you thank you police the police do a good job of it is what they look at the abused sapa lisa take it from this person now look at the royal boy we're gonna have to go back about fifteen or twenty years i think folks because what we're doing in this country now it's not working i want to tell you not working it is not working you know just organized nonsense is just nonsense you know we have the first amendment right we have a freedom of speech and we're not allowed to do that because this garbage right over here we're not allowed to do that but we'll do it because we all have a long time together that's ok we'll do it i'm going to defend you believe me we're going to defend you and i'll tell you as somebody like hillary gets in your not gonna be defended its gonna get worse and worse and worse they can end up with for more supreme court judges and you'll never recover is a country in a million use and we have something happening with us now millions and millions of people are going to the polls that have never got day going out and voting on the republican side by the way as i said democrats down 35% bernie just inspire it's a little group that won a free lunch that's all it is as solid as has 0 inspirational quality let's face it so that down just listen to this from four years ago that down 35% we're up i mean we have states a hundred and two percent up 75% up 60% up millions of people are going and voting ideally from me cause i want so much but they're voting day of voting and they never some never voted before many a democrat say came over many our independence and many many many are people that never voted before when i sign and i'll do that in a little while and when i shake hands with people people tell me i'm telling you every tenth person tells me mr. trump like a fifty year old guy sixty year old people a 70 year old actually my all time was a woman 93 years old in tennessee she never voted before and she's got at ruptured on an incredible woman never voted before she's 93 years old but we have we have people by the way it's called a movement in the history of the united states and i say it in front of these lying thieving reporters at the wars and by the way if i say it and it's a big headline trump was wrong but they're reporting it anyway they have two reported at some point they report the truth in the history of the country there's never been anything like this folks the republicans were not doing exactly well we had steps like mitt romney running for office who failed so damn badly who by the way that should have been an easy election we're running against the failed president and he trails to show up the last month's what happened to him he failed to show up and he got creamed he got beaten badly but he got beaten badly we have millions of people get outta here get outta here get them out get bye bye bye bye by the way whether they do do their rest these people and let what happens to their rest up or do they just shot i hope they arrest these people because they're really violating all of us okay and i hope they're arrested i hope they're arrested because i honestly they should be and you don't see this stuff happening at other rallies at at let's say lipper all liberal rallies you don't see it happening it doesn't happen you guys so go to their route number 12 get very bored very quickly i tell you i hope you arrest these people because i tell you they deserved to be arrested and some of them a very violent but i'm gonna ask that you arrest them i'll file whatever judges you want to know why if they wanna do this i say to the rest of the room because we're gonna go strongly fear arrest and i'm gonna do this from now on let's ruin their the rest nigga ruin the rest of their lives if they want to do this let them have a big arrests bark they got arrested for whatever it is and by the way some of these people is swinging you know we don't swing swinging meaning this is swinging and you know what that's not right it's not right trucks okay and then if you swing back it's like oh we were terrible we were terrible so i hope you arrest them and do whatever you have to do and you know what one set such happening when i can't have any more protesters were not have any more programs at 25,000 people we had three of four thousand protesters they all came at the exact same time which means it's an organized ale and is organized by the group that endorse guarantee a butt and you know they said oh well no but then they came out and they said they did it moveon.org third-rate organization they finally think they have some power bernie by the way just enjoy nearly as well as we do that i can tell you that i can judge but so we had 25,000 i had a decision to make do i go and speak and watch an unbelievable riot where a lot of people are gonna get hurt and maybe chill or do i say i'm not gonna do it and i said you know and i was totally safe but the people are going to be fighting it would have been horrible i said you know what let's not do it and it turned out to be a great great decision nobody was hurt listen to this nobody was hurt i got great credit for good reaction under pressure which is always nice right you have to react under pressure our president doesn't know how to react under pressure our president is in comput it he doesn't know what the hell is doing and then one of these people from that organization there on one of the station's last night they said i think we made a mistake truck got more publicity because of this would have ever gotten me just as though that was yesterday chicago really worked out well and a lot of we all got a lot of credit and frankly so good people weren't i mean within reason they weren't even heard it was amazing the way it worked out everybody just first and then i'm watching a couple of the programs by the way and i'm watching shots from four hours before like it slide like it's going on then i said what kept you live 20 this press i call up the road this press then i say wait a minute wait a minute i just saw that twenty minutes ago they kept free running it over and over and over like it's live television dishonest reporting design espitia very very unfair ok so today today we went to cleveland second and they were incredible we had a tremendous 25 27,000 people in this incredible incredible place but before cleveland we were in dayton dayton ohio and the crowd was unbelievable in fact really incredible we don't have anything like this we had very little disruption it was going along and all of a sudden the people in the front row shot screaming be careful watch it watch it i'm speaking and say what's this all about i look back and there's a guy charging the stage and i mean charging he put on a bulrush charging the stage and i have to tell you folks the secret service was unbelievable stand up guys they were unbelievable you know we have to give credit where credit is due you know the secret service got a little bad publicity they don't deserve this is a great group of people have gotten to know you know the crowds have been so large they said we have to have a secret service and we have got to know so many of these are incredible people incredible individuals and they aren't tough so so sorry this guy charges the people are screaming from the front row this guy is charging from behind because we were in this hangar some massive hangover much bigger than this the room was full we moved the stage way back and kept going back and then we just put a lot of people back in back of the place was packed but this guy jumps over a railing that this high fact the people that were next to him couldn't believe it and he was clapping like this the whole thing clapping clapping and then all of a sudden he jumps out and they're screaming look at my look at my sweetest guy charging now i'm elevated but they're charging he's charging he's got his girlfriend in the back screaming like crazy screaming like a total maniac at this guy is running and the secret service guys he just got to the stage and the secret service guys hit him like you wouldn't believe they took and it was a tough guy was a strong guy in fact the people couldn't believe that from a standing jump he was able to get over fifty and drilling that's a hard thing to do so in a certain way i guess he was in pretty good shape but strong but he got over this railing and you know just phony people clapping clapping clapping shows you ready jumps over tries to make a rush at me now i was ready i don't know if i would have done well but i would have been out there i don't know what i would have done well but i would have been beat that so you probably saw on television today i'm turning around and saying what's going on and i got it from those people is so great the heart you know they really they were scared to look at what's happened she dropped out and i turned around and i see this guy just totally rushing the stage and he gets it he actually had his hand on her cupped hands on the stage and i will tell you he got he got taken down you would not believe it he's gotta have he's gotta be one very sore person but but that's not the that's not the terrible part the terrible part i'm gonna tell you right so they bring them into a court and they process and the judge let him go okay all right now let me tell you if he would have gotten on stage it would have been a problem to be honest cuz it would have been a problem is he was looking to do harm this wasn't a guy that was look into you know have a little fun this was a guy there was looking to do harm so the judge let him go and then one of my people said wow they found his name and it was probably isis arises related you believe it and then they go on my my my people found this then they go online and they find the guy is playing all sorts of very listen to music that you wouldn't be like in dragon an american flag along the sidewalk make it all sorts of gestures having all sorts of things on the internet and he's probably or possibly isis related to let me just tell you where i have some real problem number one that should have been trapped down ok should be found out by one of my internet people number to this guy should be in jail right now he shouldn't be out this guy should be addressed he should be in jail for a judge to let him go is incredible but he should be in jail a law-and-order it's called law-and-order who said that that bad now you know what you said is a terrible thing that a lot of people are not it's a terrible the law and order your right here right so they let him go and after they let him go they found all this stuff about is his real love and where it comes from and the whole thing now who knows what's gonna happen when they go back to get him who knows if they're ever gonna find them again but our courts have to get tougher and chopper and smarter or we are very very we're gonna be in a lot of trouble is a country we already are we already are i mean even here today i said to the police today look you can have some protesters i know this i mean i'm pretty good at this stuff and i said you can have some protest and by the way in dayton other than him it was so beautiful in cleveland it was it was beautiful it was so beautiful the hall the crowd was massive you know this one is packed but we're it's a much smaller venue and that's why so many people can't get in there outside i hate to waste each on this people that we take god i hate i just hate to waste the seats i hate to waste a time but they get this look so you get this guy out there he's isis related all sorts of stuff back and forth and i'm saying to myself who would let a guy what country would let it die and i mean to tell you he went through and he was a tough cookie and he came through that day and have these guys were entrained tough start strong professionals he would have gotten through easily ok he would have gotten they were they were all over him man did he get taken down he got taken down like a sack of potatoes was why i've been a measure but obviously the secret service that was so incredible but now the judge lets him go and now they find out he's isis related or could be isis related it certainly is not in love with our country that i can tell you okay and we gotta get tougher folks and we gotta get stronger we have to get smarter you know we had we had a case where at the last debate before this did i win that debate that last debate you know my daughters and my wife but they said dad darling darling don't fight back don't have everyone's wondering why i get the evangelical vote number 1 i'm a good christian i have a good christian and by the way i'm not going to allow people to continue to chip away at christianity which is what they're doing i'm not going to allow it and i make you a little promise that if we win if we win we're gonna be saying merry christmas again when it's christmas is you know so during the previous one of these are the people get about a year ago get out get out being being gettin out you can see they're dying off she can see they're losing their steam we never give up to it we never averaged if we never give up so one of the moderators ask the question till i intend and they said they said senator said it accrues born in cata doubt raised for four years in canada a real question a real real question as to whether or not he can even run let's find out what they say at that is a real question by the way a lot of people that they have to be born on our land ok you can't be born in canada raised there for 45 years he was a canadian citizen until 16 months ago give me a break ok so what is this what i've been a we supposed to have laws are we supposed to be playing games but anyway let them run he's not gonna win anyway who cares so they a sly instead they said they didn't call in lyon said there's missus edifice headline ted that's a pretty bad as they talked about waterboarding right you remember and they said they'd let me ask you senator waterboarding are you in favour are you against something to that effect and he don't want to answer it because you know you did like the question he doesn't want to get involved in this he likes it one way but he's politically correct you want to be careful not to stop with his political correctness folks in skeletal so what do you think senator and he didn't want to really and she gave a very bad you know he's a good debater but he's a bad talker you understand what that means right good debater but i beat him in the debates i don't know why is this coming but he's a good debate about doctors say is what happens so i dont wanna answer then they look at me what do you think of waterboarding was to try now i i didnt just say it's good i said listen in the middle east a chopping off heads in the middle east a drowning people in cages like animals that drowning people forty fifty people in cages that putting them in dumping them for one hour pulling it up everyone dead this hasn't happened since medieval times when i'd rate i always loved history and i'd read about different periods and i'm thinking medieval times right that's like river the chopping of the head and we only saw it with james foley this beautiful person whose parents i got to know incredible people i i help them with their foundation but these are great people and the sun was as beautiful person and that was the first we saw the james foley and then it happened with others and then you'd see twenty of them and 15 of them and if you a christian you are really in trouble so they're chopping off the heads of christians and i said and anybody else who got in their way is your animal stuffed animals these are these are animals and i was against going into regular doctor while he was let me tell you believe me i was against the rules against i was get it was a mistake to go in it was a tremendous respect the way obama got us out because the way he gotta remember i said keep the oil keep you know in the old days added expression to the victory belongs the spoils right right victor victoria victor we get nothing you know we get we spent two trillion dollars on a stupid war that totally destabilize the middle east that a red now takes over iraq without firing a bullet forever they've been trying to take over and they've been fighting back and forth but the military's were even so that fight and fight for 23 years bombs is way bob nothing happened there dressed then they go back inside we decapitated one of the army's we get decapitated one of the country's we leave around secular over second richest oil reserves in the world is iraq nobody knows that iran's getting them a ranch getting a hundred and fifty billion dollars this crazy deal that was made by secretary kerry who is horrible never once walked right never once one never wants to walk so anyway so i said to him there decapitating people they're drowning people and they're chopping off heads yes i am in favor of waterboarding ok and i said that as far as i'm concern you can go a lot stronger than waterboarding if you'd like and believe me it works it works you know i watch some of these week general say what a boring so it works folks ok we got a lot of information and not that i want it not that i like it i hate the concept of any kind of torture it's horrible but they're chopping off heads and they're drowning people by the dozens and what we have and then i fear that i hear that mr. trump said a horrible thing because he's not going by the law and the law doesn't allow because of obama he brought it up one step higher doesn't allow waterboarding anymore right so i said no no i want to obey the laws we have to obey the laws particular they chopped off hats and we talked about weekend to waterboarding and figure this we have dinner right tonight you going home you having dinner i have dinner you have dinner we all have dinner you guys up there but that's a lot of paper actually good she said get a good view of all this stuff but but let me just tell you and thank you for being here thank you and especially thank you to the people outside who didn't even get it i think they have loudspeakers outside but that's not quite the same thing they don't get to see the action right so sorry is a sorry they have dinner we had dinner we all have dinner well i say we're dealing with scum but they have dinner can you imagine these guys sitting around the dinner saying that the stupid americans aren't allowing waterboarding which a lot of people don't consider torture you know to question who knows it is it isn't they it's a it's a it's like the mildest form so some people think it's torture some people don't dislike a borderline so they cut off heads they chopped off heads and we can't wait to board so what we're doing is we're playing on a different field we have rules and regulations they have nothing you don't win wars like that folks we have to increase our rules and regulations so we can play a tougher game ok we have to change so so here's something a friend of mine is very rich and i've done it one time before i believe what i read it i think is incredible done by al wilson years ago and it was written and think in terms of terror and terrorism gotta stop the problem folks were gonna build up our military and we are going to be so strong so powerful that nobody's gonna mess with us anymore nobody nobody so here's a little was written i guess was put in the form of a song but a friend of mine is really successful city gotta read that again to read it you gotta read it to the folks in kansas city gotta read it i said i'll do it i'll do it and i took it out and i might have done it once or twice but i love it i think it's so great think of this in terms of terror and in terms of terrorists ok as we negotiate we bargain sometimes you can't bargain so well you have to show strength you have to show strength on her way to work one morning but as you with us or against us are you with us or against us you know sometimes somebody stands up and that with me i think they're protesters ok are you a protest sarah are you a protest sarah where is this guy i guess he's with us ok ready i hope they get put in these guys get thrown into a jail cell never do it again it'll destroy their record to have to explain to mom and dad why they have a police record and why they can't get a job and you know what i'm gonna start pressing charges against all these people and then we won't have a problem and i don't want to do that i dont wanna ruin somebody's life there probably good kids you know that probably good i don't want to ruin people's lives but the only way we're going to stop this craziness is it will press charges because then their lives are going to be ruined they gonna know their lives to go to be ruined so i just tell you folks from now on if you do anything with pressing charges ok so this call this on her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake is pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the do oh well she cried out take you in and i'll take care of you take be in 10 to women take the end for heaven's sake take bien o tender woman side the broken snake

gonna call this special interest group within 24 hours ahead of jerry is gonna call me and he's going to say mr. president we have decided to stay in the united states tank used her so here's the end of the story we don't want any more folks we don't want a trade we get killed with everybody we have the worst trade deals with the best rate deals with it he was the smartest people with the greatest business people in the world they'll do it for nothing they want to do it so badly we don't want a trade our businesses are being ripped out of our country our jobs and money are being ripped out of our country we all 19 trillion dollars we owe china 1.7 trillion dollars we r japan think of this they sell cars we owe them money ok that's a trick right we owe them 1.5 trillion dollars here's a story we're gonna win on trade we're gonna win with our vets were gonna take care of our veterans to take care of we're gonna rebuild our military we're gonna be so strong so powerful nobody's ever gonna mess with us it's the cheapest single thing we can do believe me instead of make it a week and saving we're gonna make it strong and we won't have to fight wars cause nobody's gonna play games with us anymore like they do now ok nobody we're going to bring our education local we gonna get rid of common core it's a disaster we're going to repeal and replace obamacare it's going to be repealed we're going down as strong borders when i get on at the drugstore in we're not going to let people come in that are illegal people can come in but they have to come in legally we're gonna build a wall we're going to build a wall mexico is going to pay for the wall other trade deficit with mexico a fifty eight billion dollars a year these two senators come up to me first of all they said you'd ever built a wall now they're all saying all we have to build a wall now they say you'll never get mexico to pay so look at this year all smart people if we have fifty eight billion dollar trade deficit with mexico meaning that do a much better than we're doing is just another of a horrible deals and if the wall is going to cause has approximately ten billion dollars and i'll bring it ahead of schedule and under budget cuz that's when i do okay so we can have a real well we're gonna but if you have 56 and 58 billion dollars trade deficits you have a ten billion dollar wall guess what happens it's real easy to get mexico to pay for the wall and once i explained that they still don't understand it and it doesn't matter if they understand it because they controlled by lobbyists and special interests so even if they understand it then not gonna do it they're not gonna create bidding for the pharmaceutical companies because the pharmaceutical companies take care of all these people nobody was better as you know eight months ago i was the ultimate in the establishment i know the system better than anybody folks we're gonna fix the system we have a broken country we're

thank you well we have a lot of things to discuss but we had some very bad news a few days ago and you saw what happened a lot of bad things are happening and i was going to go through a whole litany of of that but we don't want to we want to be upbeat we want to be positive we want to be strong and we're going to be strong we're going to be stronger than ever before we're going to be greater than ever before we're going to bring our jobs back we're going to bring our military back its being depleted so badly we're gonna take care of our veterans which we have to take care of we're going to get rid of obamacare which is a disaster and replace it with something terrific we end common core we bring our education back to the local communities like this local community where the people love their children and they want to see their children be well educated so important we're going to save our second amendment we're going to save our second time and it's under seen you know i wrote a few words today and i think it's important that we go through it as a group it's been a special place and your special people and i know so many people tonight in the audience and you're all over look at all those cameras up there folks look at all those cameras they don't stop they don't stop but i just wanted to say i wrote this quickly but it means that came right from the heart and i have to say that our whole nation grieves in mourns for the loss of five heroes in dallas law enforcement these were great great people great people we pray for their families we pray for their loved ones we pray for all the wounded survivors we pray for our country so important the police are not just part of our society our police are the best of our society remember that we have to remember them they represent our highest ideals our greatest values and our most noble characteristics when our police are attacked our entire nation is attacked remember the remember them so the message must be delivered clearly for all to hear the hostility against our police has to end and it has to end right now and we have to say together and we have to be strong we have to take care of everyone the two people that were killed in louisiana and minnesota it was tough it was tough to watch for everybody here was tough to watch we have to figure it out we have to figure out what's going on was it training was it something else it could have been something else we have to take care of everybody remember that but we have to also we have to get to the bottom of things we have to but we can never ever forget the hundreds of thousands of great deals and great things that are police all over the country do and nobody recognizes them for what they do and when there's a problem as bad as these two situations were and i personally think they were they were bad i hated i hated watching it but as bad as they were they get broadcast all over the world for days and days and all of the good things which are magnified thousands of times nobody talks about so we have to remember we have to cherish and take care of our place if we don't if we don't we don't have a country anymore we have a country in chaos and remember this and i say it once and i say it with love and i say it with compassion because i have love for our country and i have great compassion for our people in our country but i am the law and order candidate we need law and order and we need strength in this country we don't have strength in our country we have crooked hillary clinton as crooked as you get when you saw that with the emails it's a rigged system folks it's a rigged system just remember it it's a rigged system it's rigged in so many different ways we're going to straighten it out you can't even watch what happens we had a young man who did nothing by comparison to what she did and he warned his friends of a problem that was coming militarily and they came down on him with a vengeance and they let her go 33,000 missing emails they let her go lies all over the place and they let her go think of it to disgrace so we're going to get on to other subjects but i have to say law enforcement has to remain with us we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement officials were going to do it we're going to continue to do it we're going to remember that they do a fabulous job we're going to remember they do a great job and every once in a while problems will happen and we're going to take care of those problems and they could be bad problems but we are going to treat our police with respect remember that ok now i'm looking at different rates in different crimes and you see the crime rate in large portions of our country is going way up you look at certain inner cities and look at chicago look at what's going on since president obama became president almost 5,000 killings in chicago and nobody talks about it well we're going to start talking about it because we have to make this a safe country and you know i would say two weeks ago a month ago i wouldn't be saying these words i was talking about the border and i was talking about the wall and we will build the wall that i didn't you i can tell you now we're going to build what don't worry about it are you ready who is going to pay for the wall i don't hear you who's going to pay for the wall and they will very much they were a hundred percent and you know what they'll be happy to pay for the wall we have a trade deficit with mexico that you wouldn't believe billions and billions and billions of dollars a year we'll lose him on the border we're losing entree and when i was in the debates and i've mentioned this people would come up that i was debating against and they used to say donald you are really going to build a wall are you i say absolutely they said but you can't build the wall but i'm in the construction now easier wallace a wall we build 95 story buildings with bathrooms that stuff construction not a wall walls don't have bathrooms and bathrooms are always tough but we're going to have a very big beautiful gate and that were big and beautiful and that gates going to be open and it's going to be wide open for people to come into our country but they're going to come into our country legally they're going to come in legally yeah and they're going to be people that love our country they're not going to be people that hate our country they're not going to be people that we don't know where they come from they're not going to be people that come from the migration that don't have paperwork that don't have passports that we have no idea where they're from we have no idea what their motives are we're gonna say no sorry no and will help and in syria will build safe zones and we'll get other people to put up the money because we are going to oh very soon 20 trillion trillion with a team nobody even knows what it means we're going on 24 right now can you believe this 20 trillion dollars soon going to 21 trillion dollars so we're gonna get the gulf states who have so much money for so much money and we're going to get them to put up the money and others and we're going to take care of people and we're going to have compassion but we can't allow him to come into our country we have enough problems right now you see what happened in orlando you see what happens in borodino we can't allow it to happen so we're going to build safe zones we're going to take care of people we're going to have other people fund these safe zones we're going to build up our military we should have never been in iraq but once we went into iraq we should have never left the way we left we left like fools we went in should have never happened i didn't want to go from the beginning and i have proof from the beginning i didn't want a rack i said you're going to destabilize the entire middle east so that's exactly what happened but then we were there losing thousands of lives spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably in the middle east were up to four trillion dollars and we're in worse shape now than we were 15 years ago before the whole deal started forward not even close far worse far worse so what we're going to do is we're going to start thinking smart we're going to be smart again we're going to make great military and by the way i said for years we've got to keep the oil i said keep the ore you leave you keep the oil we didn't do it we didn't do it i said it for years once we were in i said when we get out it's going to be a disaster but when we get out we should have left sub troops there and i hate saying that but we should have left some troops there and it would have been better certainly than it is right now can't be any worse but i always said keep the oil but we didn't keep the oil so who has the oil right now a lot of the oil is had by isis and we created isis and hillary clinton threw her in confidence directly and indirectly created isis and now she wants to get rid of it she stands yes we will find i said she's the one that created it with stupidity was stupid stupid policy policy that's only going to get worse she is the one that created and that's what's happened and so now we have problems all over the place we have our cities exploded we have isis looking at us and by the way when our enemies all over the world including our friends all over the world look at what's happening to our country where the other night you had 11 think of in 11 cities potentially at a blow-up stage marches all over the united states and tough marches anger hatred hatred started by a maniac that some people asked for a moment of silence for him for the killer for the killer ok so when our enemies look at what's going on with our country they see our deficits they see we don't win anymore we don't win we don't we don't win anything i always say when i was going when i was young going to high school and going to college and before that we never lost you know united states they said i'd never lost a war now we never win we don't win on trade we don't win with our military our military so depleted our military has fighter jets that are in use flown by great great american people that is so old and they can't get parts for the fighter just these are people flying these shits now in combat they can't get parts so they go to the plane graveyards in the deserts they go to museums where they have similar planes and they strip the plains of parts to use for our fighter pilots to fly this is what we've been reduced to and i'll tell you something hillary clinton is incompetent ok the greatest single thing in my opinion that she's ever done is to get out of the email problem i think it's incredible she did a great job on that that's it i think it's the greatest achievement i think when they look back on hillary clinton they will say the greatest achievement of hillary clinton was getting out of this problem with emails nobody got houdini couldn't have got now she was so guilty i have a list look page after page of the lies page after page the lies all over look at this page page i look i don't want to read it to you the press would say you should spend your entire speech talking about hillary clinton and the emails i don't want to talk about you know what it was all lies folks i don't have to go through and bore everybody it was so horrible it was so disgusting it was so outrageous you look at general petraeus look what happened to him for a tiny fraction of what crooked hillary did you look at other people for a tiny fraction look at what happened to them so i just tell you this we have a candidate on the other side who if she ever gets elected it will be for more disgusting years of obama it will be four more years of weakness it'll be four more years of civil unrest it will be four more years of not winning with our military and not winning against isis they don't have a clue how to beat isis they don't have a clue but it'll be four more years of obama and obamacare and all of these things that don't work except i think actually it will be worse today i see bernie sanders gave her this furry you know sort of strange endorsement i want to tell you a lot of bernie sanders people are so upset about it they're going to be voting for trump i really believe that they're going to be voting for trump they're gonna be voting for the job because the one thing that bernie sanders and i have in common with straight now he can't do anything about it he just knew it was bad i know how to fix it because i am in favor of free trade you a lot of people say i'm an isolationist ok course when you're losing eight hundred billion dollars here and trade deficits maybe that's not the worst thing but we're going to straighten it out i believe in open borders for trade i believe in free trade the problem we have is that virtually every single country that deals with us are far sharper and far better they have their best negotiators we have people that are political acts to go shopping for us we have people that don't know what they're doing i have the greatest business men in the world that have endorsed me including people like carl icahn great businessman we have some of the greatest negotiators may be the greatest negotiators in the world we don't use them we use political hacks we have people in there the garden for politics you can look at the biggest companies in the world and its small potatoes its peanuts compared to some of these massive trade deals and we have people that should never be negotiating trade deals just like we have secretary of state kerry negotiating with iran and what they did to him and you because he has no idea what the hell he was doing and what he gave away israel is in serious jeopardy frankly we're in serious jeopardy and we made a power out of her n we made up our number one we should have never gone and negotiated that deal until we got our hostages back ever ever we should have never ever gone in and what you say is folks we have to get them back and if you don't want to give them back you leave the meeting you leave the mean and you double up your sanctions you would have had a back within 24 hours i guarantee you that but we didn't do that we never left any minute i kept waiting for the whole delegation i kept waiting for them to leave to get up and leave i used to say get up and leave perfect get up we didn't win anything the only time that carry left was at 73 years old to go into a bicycle race where he fell and broke his like right and i always tell people i promise you i will never enter a bicycle race when i'm in the midst of an important nuclear negotiation i promise i promise but when you look at it number one we should have gotten them back in the other thing we should have never given him back the hundred and fifty billion and i would have said very nicely my father used to think i was a little bit rough and he used to go easy son son take it nice and easy you got to take the lumps out he had expression good father we are like grandfather's i hope i had a good father but i learned a lot he said that he'd go like this with his hand said you got to take the lump sound take the lumps easy nice and easy take the lump said you live too rough what it may pop your little too rough and over the years i think i've learned that make great deals built a great company great company took advantage of every single thing you can't because you're working for yourself you're working for your family you're working for your employees your cover took advantage of every law some of these are the dumbest laws i've ever said some of these laws are so stupid but you know you take advantage of you like a business person right got to take advantage of them because you're really representing your employees your company your family but my father would say take the lumps out so here's what i would have set of the hundred and fifty in the old days when i was young and say we're not paying you back the 150 billion you're not getting it would be a lot of heart feeling right in the room you know take a while that it's still come back don't worry about because they need us they need us and then i would have left and he'll go to the sanctions i would have done two things number one hostages before we start buttering the first work but number two i would and how long were those hostages that that negotiation took forever and we didn't want to . we lost everything they're gonna be a nuclear power they're rich they're powerful how about yemen they're fighting on the other side of yemen we're fighting they're fighting i said why didn't they make the deal to get out of yemen and kerry said because he didn't want to complicate the negotiations commitment no can you believe we're fighting each other we're talking about one thing they don't want to bring something else it's too complicated these are amateurs but my father would say take the lumps out so here's what i would have said number one we now be negotiated because our prisoners would have been back years ago years ago i would have said fellas look here's a story is the story we have a problem our country's flat broke we are 19 trillion going to be 20 now with the omnibus budget going to be 21 trillion very soon i want to give you the money back i really do we don't have it i'm sorry they would have gone nuts they would have said what do you mean you gotta give us the most no no we want to we don't have it i want to so badly we love you use such great people such nice people so kind take a look at what they do to their hostage of their prisoners you'll find out about tough people great negotiators persians great negotiators i would have said remember nice and easy i would have rather done it my way but i respected my father so i would have said we don't have the money can't do it they would have left we would have left we would have been back in two weeks okay we would have said 250 billion dollars so there's still things we would have had our hostages back we would have saved a hundred and fifty billion now they're so rich they're buying airliners they're buying everything and buying probably nuclear weapons we just don't know about it ok they'll do they have to do nuclear weapons you know worried about their making new clue up and they'll buy him they've got the money they made such fools out of us folks those days are over there over there over there i call obama the 541 president so we have a trader named sergeant bergdahl so sergeant bergdahl think she likes their way of life obviously they have a wonderful way of life so one day he leaves we lose five and maybe six but five at least people looking for him they were killed they were killed by the enemy they go out there looking for they knew he left everybody with him know he left because he was all worked out and a believer in them not us so they knew he left so knowing that fact they had a colonel and i believe a general talking to the people that know him and they told the colonel in the general that he left he deserted remember the old days a deserter what happened buying 20 years ago it was bank but slowly ten years ago as long prison today they're probably talking about nothing that's where we've come but i call them to fight for one so we get bergdahl right a traitor they get five of the most vicious killers that they have that they've been after for nine years to get them out and they bring them in the back of the battlefield trying to kill everybody including us this stuff is going to stop folks and get mo we're not close it get mom we're gonna fill it up when i close to get back we're not close a different and i see hillary clinton said i do not like donald trump stone look here's the story i think i have a great temperament she uses the word type of it but i loved what she is the work done i do not like donald trump's on there chopping off heads of christians and anybody else that gets in the way chopping heads up we haven't seen that since medieval times right you read the history books that's a chopped-off heads well they're chopping off heads they're drowning people in steel cages by the dozens at a time and she says we are we don't like his tone let me tell you folks it's time for a tough tone we've had enough we've had it up we've had enough we've had enough so we're going to do things the smart way i remember during the debate they asked one of the folks on the debate stage he's becoming friendly and friendlier by the day with me which some of the people are recovering it was ok what they say it was the nastiest primary that anybody has seen they say the nastiest in recorded history who knew what went on before recorded but it was pretty nasty and some of the folks i saw one yesterday i will not even mention it because i want to be friends with everybody right it'll be friends except for the real enemy but they'll sign a document right it's called the pledge i pledge i pledge i swear i pledge that if i don't make it i'm going to support the nominee of the party it doesn't say subject to change change subject to the weather subject to the sun doesn't come up no it said i pledge and for that pledge they got access to millions of dollars worth of material from the republican national committee the rnc rights previous a great guy by the way great guys doing a great job got to telluride scrapers doing great and if he wasn't i tell you and if he doesn't over the next four or five weeks i'll tell you but he is a good man and his whole staff is doing a great job but they get access so they signed the pledge that they will support now i don't really i don't want their support won't mean one vote other than perhaps their family won't mean it doesn't mean anything but i signed the pledge to and everybody wanted to sign the pledge and the reason they sign the pledge was to get me decide that i signed it i would have honored it i just say people should honor pledges people should honor documents with a son you know not a big deal not a big deal but they should on so here's the story folks we're losing our country where like a piece of swiss cheese at the borders that's gonna that's going to end you know the border patrol agents 16,500 first time in history that they did this had never done this before 16,500 border patrol agents have endorsed donald trump they know better than anybody what's going on at the bottom and by the way if and when we win its way i'm just a messenger folks i'm telling a message of common sense i'm telling a message of strength but i'm your messenger and i'm doing a good job as a message i mean you know in all fairness but 16,500 border patrol agents endorse donald trump if they didn't have jobs much easier what they do now is a stand there beautiful equipment great people people walk right by them that's an easy job they can't stand it because they don't like what's coming into our country they want to do their job with me they're going to be working really hard and i said to him when they called me to tell me about the endorsement never done it before they'd ever endorsed the presidential candidate before 16,500 great great people and i said so let me tell you i want to ask you this question how important is the wall they said mr. trump the wall is vital i don't know what i would have done if they said it's not important i would have to say i guess what i'm building it because i respect these but they know better than anybody they know i hell of a lot better than the consultants and all these people that are making millions of dollars that don't have a clue who's better at that i said how important is the world mr. trump never forget the answer the wall is vital vital very important very important to actually said it's a tool toward real security and important too and then i spoke with sheriff joe arpaio from arizona and he called me out of the blue and i've read about your job i mean he knows borders write amazing guy tough guy but he's an amazing guy and he said mr jump i just want you to know that i'm endorsing you because you know more about this stuff that anybody you know more about this stuff than people doing it for 25 years you get it you know what's happening i'm endorsing you and he's actually a quality person he's a tough guy but he's a quality person he gets the job done amazing so i know about that and when it was coming time for the wall i'll never forget vincent a fox your former president on one of the major networks use the f-bomb remember i told the story couple of times he said we will not pay for the f-bomb wall i said all he's dead can you imagine is going to be headlines tomorrow he's gonna live television i said oh no i feel so badly for the gun now in one way i was happy because he used to say will never build the wall now he's saying will never pay for the wall so we made a lot of progress at least he's now admitting is going to go right and he seemed like a nice guy but he got a little bit rough we will never play for the f-bomb well i said article guy he's gonna get killed tomorrow in the papers nobody mentioned it can you imagine if i throughout the f-bomb i think it would be the electric chair right would it be electric chair now the press i have to take those people back there i die i will tell you this not all of them but many of them are the most dishonest human beings on earth they are the most dishonest human beings on earth i've had days that is so good and then you wake up the next morning and you say man did they take that i won't even say what things i could go one after another and we don't make a lot of mistakes all of us will make mistakes but what they do is they'll take a sentence and they'll make it much different than what you said much different from what you meant and all of a sudden there's a daughter from had a bad week because he said something perfect perfect okay perfect i'm telling you folks and i tell it all the time because as a republican and a republican conservative we are at a tremendous disadvantage you look at the way they treat crooked hillary you take you take a look at this compared to the way they treat other people or the way they treat me they are some of the worst human beings on earth i really minute i really mean you know where are my protesters i want to protest you know look at this room the governor just said he's never seen a room like this in indiana with this many people he's never seen anything like it what is this is where your football team for a look at the ceilings everything is nice let's see what my heart you know i always talk about the walls gonna be real high but that's really high up there that's a big one but they don't see crowds like this we have crabs like this everywhere no matter where we go and every time i go home my wife said how was the crowd and i always say didn't you see it they keep those cameras on my face they never take the cameras off my face because they don't want people i wish that turn those cameras over here take a look at this crowd take a look at this look the cameras are moving their really dishonest i i really mean this they are so just honest that's why i love my protesters because the only time they moved the cameras are when we have a protest if somebody were up there screaming or shouting the cameras which i used to think we're in a fixed position i said maybe mechanically they can't move but when we have a protester they turn and printed like a pretzel all over wha through the camera man's legs up around his ankles you never saw cameras move like this the fact is that you have to know what you're getting and the system is wonderful in many ways but really bad in others and one of the worst aspects of our system is the dishonest press the dishonest media is one of the worst thing i really mean they write and say things that are disgraceful so and i like to say you know what because when people see things to read things hear things they'll say i'll tell you what one of the most incredible people said what have you learned i said you know what i've learned how smart the people are because their rating is so low they're so thought of so badly it's like how smart the people were and i'll say this various anchors some of whom truly just like donald trump said what's happened to us to us i'm messenger you're the important ones in this whole thing but what happened to us is one of the greatest political phenomenon as they've ever seen in this country in the history of the country i didn't even know that i didn't even know bill o'reilly of course i'm on a show tonight so if you get home you see the second edition but bill o'reilly said the single greatest political phenomena that he's seen in his lifetime nice pro smart guy tough tough but the single greatest political phenomena that he's seen in his lifetime is donald trump and and all of us the whole thing we've been on the cover we've been on the cover of time magazine we've been on the cover of time magazine so much it becomes routine fact they just told me mr. trump sir you're under cover of time magazine again this week i said all right you know the old days i'd say wow that's a big deal now it's like really that's good that's all right you're on the cover of time magazine i'm not on the cover of time magazine you're on the company just remember that so we have a lot of things that are taking place we have a bad enemy we have an enemy that's dishonest we have a process that's dishonest we have a group of people that want to get elected who have a rigged system and who have really rig the system to a large extent they've really rig the system you can say what you want about bernie sanders but those super-delegates that was worse than what happened with us and frankly the only reason i could win is we wanted such landslides all over the place including indiana what i landslide that one and we love bobby knight do we love bobby knight god bobby knight i love my bobby night we had so many coaches gene and digger bobby and we had so many coaches blue notes we had so many coaches that came out in our favor i do well with coaches i'll tell you what the coaches like me but bobby was out here working really hard and i could see it right at the beginning this was gonna be the watershed we weren't but bobby came out and i came out and we went to arenas you have never seen so many people many of you many a lot of you were at those arenas but it's been amazing so here's the story folks we've gotta stop four more years of obama we've gotta stop hillary clinton whose as crooked as they come we've got to bring our country back we have to make great trade deals again we're gonna make deals that bring our jobs back and we don't get along great with these countries and we're gonna trade with these countries i have not in isolation is some of free trader but i'm a free trader to make great deals not to make horrible deals one of the people standing right there start to me this is a drop are you an isolationist and mr. trump i said no as mr. trump well what's your definition of trade since very simple very simple i know free i no fair i know every form of trade known to mankind ok here's my definition of trade my definition of trade is that i want to make great deals for the american people you can call it whatever the hell you want ok and we're going to we're going to bring our jobs back we're going to bring our manufacturing back you look at what's happened to the manufacturing since bill clinton sign probably the worst deal economically in the history of our country nafta that deal was signed by bill clinton you look at areas even from here but you look at places you look at places like new england and new york state and pennsylvania great state we're leaving in pennsylvania by the way it came out i here we are leading in florida i here we are leading in ohio i hear we're leading all over the place and the rasmussen poll just came out where leading nationally but we have a long way to go and we're dealing with the dishonest system we're dealing with a crooked system we're dealing with a rigged system will get a long way to go folks and we don't want anybody to take it away from us and when this person said to me by the way what you've done has never been done before congratulations it doesn't even matter if you win or lose the election what you've done has never been done before winning all the primers beating great professionals and they're very talented people beating this it's never been done before you'll go down in the history books mr. truck i said do me a favor don't even tell me about it because if i don't win the next one i will consider it a big fat waste of time and 55 million dollars i put up and i'm still putting up a lot more now we raise 51 million dollars less month that we started toward the middle of the month and everyone was shocked and much of that buddy came in small donations like $71 average or something like that and i put up millions but i did it like i want to incentivize people i want people to realize i'm raising money for the republican party and the rnc that's what we want to do because we want to keep our majority we want to keep our house we want to keep our senate because i'll tell you what if we can do that and we have trump as president we are going to be able to do things that are going to be so great for our country gonna be amazing you know where one of the highest tax stations in the world and yet in going around and meeting with people small businesspeople big business people if they had their chance and if they had their choice they would rather get rid of rules and regular we have the worst regulations anywhere in the world they actually would rather pay more tax which is surprising and get rid of these regulations that are choking everybody people can't run their businesses so we're going to turn things around we're going to turn around fast we're not going to lose carrier air conditioning from indianapolis you know that deal very well those people have followed be all over the place - 1,400 people out of jobs viciously they're moving to mexico any of the carrier folks in this room because we have we have a lot of do they look at that what you in the back row used to be the front row but we had during this season we had so many of them to follow us around they felt so badly we're not gonna let that happen when people and countries take our companies and take our jobs there are gonna be consequences they're not gonna take up because we're not going to let carrier come in make air conditioners in mexico sell the air conditions to us across a very strong border now without consequence and when we explained to the heads of carrier that here's the story either stay or if you want to go to mexico we wish you a lot of luck but when you sell your air conditioners you're gonna pay you thirty five percent tax as those air conditioners cross the border and you know what's gonna happen they're not gonna move they're not gonna move this government was thinking about low interest loans zero interest loans all sorts of ways how to keep our companies they don't need that don't need money to making plenty of money but we're not going to let them just take our company's out fire everybody these are people with carrier for many many years we're not going to let it happen and we're gonna have a country that's so spartacus so here's the story folks we don't want any more we're going to start winning we're gonna win with our military we're going to kick the hell out of isis we have to edit we have no choice we're going to take care of our vets so important our bets are big treated so badly i have such great veterans support we're going to take care of our veterans we're going to have strong borders we're going to have the wall of that wall is going to be as beautiful as a wall could be somebody said mr job sir they gonna call it the trump wall i said well then i better build it big and beautiful right now now i don't want that but we need we need great borders because without borders we don't have a country we're gonna make great trade deals our jobs are going to come back we're gonna make a lot of money on trade right now we lose all of this money you look at japan the biggest ships you've ever seen floating and i was in los angeles they floated these massive massive ships loaded up with cars and the cars are pouring just like i mean nascar i love nascar i love brian francie endorsed me from nascar right a scar it's like that's car drivers king richard endorse me a lot of the guys endorse me richard petty they come in they're pouring off these boats we send them wheat we send them beef i want to get said they don't even want it they send it back you want to see trade imbalance take a look at the balance we have with japan is going to end folks we're gonna have smart people now we're going to make great deals we're gonna make fair just we get along great with japan we're going to get along great with we're gonna get along better with these countries and they're going to treat us fairly and we have all the cards just remember that with a piggy bank but they're going to break our piggy bank very soon but with the piggy bank they take the money out we have rebuilt china the money they've taken out of this country i mean they have trains that we can only dream about they have high ways that we can only dream about places outside of this country in the middle east different places have airports that we can only dream about we used to be at the top now we're like a third-world country so here's what i say we're going to start winning again we're going to win so much you're going to be so proud of your country we're going to win so much you're gonna be so happy you're going to have your jobs back you're gonna have your pride back i often joke you'll be calling up mike pence i don't know whether he's going to be your governor of your vice president who the hell knows but you're going to call up a good man but you got to call them and you can even say governor or vice president sir please please speak to mr. trump we're winning too much we the people of indiana cannot stand all of these victories we can't take it we're not used to it please we're winning without military where be no isis we're winning and trade we're winning at the border with stopping drugs from pouring in we're winning on education we're winning with our second amendment please please mike help us we're winning too much and mike will come to see me so mr. president sir

going to make america is so great again we're going to make america greater than ever before i love you indiana thank you for all your help you're really special people thank you we love you thank you very much yeah yeah yeah yeah ok thank you thank you very much so i have to tell you this is why our country doesn't work you understand so we have thousands of people in a room next door we have plenty of space here we have thousands of people outside trying to get in and we have a fire marshal that said we can't allow more people and it really is so unfair to the people i'm i'm so sorry and i have to apologize but it's not my fault i just came here but we have thousands of beautiful wonderful great people outside and we have in the room next door over a thousand people they won't let him in and the reason that won't let him in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing that's why okay too bad that's why our country has from hey baby there a hillary person could that be possible probably i don't think there are too many of them i don't think there are too many of them anyway they set up a screen in the other room they set up something outside but what it what a disgraceful situation so what you people can't be complaining right you can't people all right yeah so much so much straighten out in this country this is the kind of this is the kind of think we have in federal government also by the way folks you know and then you wonder why we're going to hell that's why we're going to hell so i thought you know what it is it's the thought process right so i watched last night i watched hillary clip quad said water sad situation and by the way they're going to let some of these people i just was informed they're going to let some of a meandering the end too bad but i watch her last night giving a speech that was so average and i watched last night as the network said it was all right it was good that was fine and then i watch this morning it was unbelievable it was so wonderful there was a wonderful folks and then i were at a report that just came out i can't believe it in political political i can't believe that and they wrote something old cliches all just written up by it by a scriptwriter and it was all clichés you know they used a little tweak one on me about tweet and she said something about the campaign donald trump doesn't know how to campaign something like that i just be 16 people and i'm beating her yeah i think i'm watching it i'm watching it oh and by the way is very important so the nielsen ratings just came out these aren't paul's these are for television much more important than paul's you know television these guys don't care about ray they don't care about pulse they only care about ready and the nielsen ratings just came out so it's drop against clinton right and you know you heard about how wonderful cuz i'll tell you what i liked the republican convention better i did i like the fall i like to call i thought we had a far more beautiful set like not even a contest how about the first night they had no american flags up on the stage second night no american flags and then i started saying there are no american flags up there and then they run up with a flag right and then last night they put so many flags you know it's called overkill its golden competence they put so many flags up there didn't know what to do you didn't know what to do but let me just tell you so thursday to thursday that's the big one right thursday we beat her by millions on television . we beat her by a lot and they both did good really we beat her by a lot but honestly the numbers were incredible which tells you which tells you isn't it good to have trump running for the presidency now let me ask school so we beat her we peter and i think you tune it out of curiosity with her you have to add most people have you i was actually more curious i was curious to see whether should do a class act and not mention my name or mentioned it with respect like say i'd like to congratulate my republican opponent for having done something that nobody has ever done in the history of politics in this nation and i would like to congratulate my opponent for having gotten more votes than anybody in the history of the republican party in the primary sources see i thought she might do stuff like that i don't you give me a big fat beautiful congratulation you know if she did that would that would that have been cool with that have been with that have been great i thought her daughter did very well by the way chelsea i thought she did very well and my daughter likes chelsey and chelsey likes my daughter what are you gonna do that's the way it is right that's ok that's ok my daughter likes chelsea ivanka i don't get too great right but i asked the vodka i said you like chelsea i do did really know i really do oh i wish you didn't it would be a lot easier right now but they like a gel she likes of vodka and so i think that's nice and that's the way life is and that's the way life should be right don't worry it with its okay its okay but we had i i had an amazing time and i i watched last night as different people spoke much of it was scripted much of it was scripted i see some people i see some people you know what was funny i said yesterday one of the rallies week with his massive rallies honestly much bigger than this but not much bigger if you let all the other thousands in that much more this is like an intimate gathering true that's true but i said - i said to some of the people look at that and then yesterday at the rally i said boy because i had some people up there that i knew and i actually saw their names and i said well that's why would they put them up they're going to speak so positively about the i was wrong and i said i'm going to hit them i'm going to get them am i going to get them i'm going to start talking about them like you never believe i'm going to hit them now obviously i'm talking about with my verbal so i'm going to get them i'm going to let them have it may be a tweet or maybe this or that but i'm gonna hit them hard so i'm gonna hit a mark so on cnn this morning i see you know on the bottom trump says she's going to hit speakers i mean they are so dishonest i'm going to hit speakers oh yeah that's why we have to win right that's why we have that i'll tell you cnn is really you know they caught the clinton news network it's really a dishonest group of people they are terrible other camera just went off you know i see the red lights i know i know all the cameramen by now right i fellas but i see the red lights that red light just went off so fast there was studying and we were having fun yes i said they said really bad things i'm going to hit them on going to hit them hard we're gonna get him and almost i said in fact i even called up a friend of mine the governor called up he actually called me he said you're doing great fantastic and i talked about the thing he said don't do anything don't do anything don't say anything bad about anybody don't talk i told him to destroy yesterday and then they put trump to hit because it's somebody said i'm gonna hit them on with him or i mean verbally right does everybody understand headline trump threatens right i don't know if they said that but it is really i'll tell you cn ns ozona since it's actually disgusting you wanted other foot so so i love is it better when we don't have these teleprompters right i want i watch hillary no matter what no matter where she goes to get teleprompters and i like using teleprompters it really good but but you know honestly when you do these things would be better but okay if i'm standing here like this and i'm going ladies and gentlemen of colorado welcome welcome oh lift that teleprompter a little breakfast well wouldn't it be nice if she would actually get up and just talk to the crowd it'd be real and she had a speech this morning and the reading teleprompters you know she has a group of 12 people she's got teleprompters in front and then she doesn't your news conferences she hasn't done one and like what is it 237 days something like she hasn't done a news conference in something like 237 days and and honestly the reason is you couldn't do a news conference because they'll ask about all the different things that she's done they'll ask her about the fbi saying she's a liar they'll ask her about all of the emails that she deleted or a racer got rid of 33,000 emails you know the ones that were done the ones that were done for her yoga class right yoga yoga the ones that were done for the wedding 33,000 i've done a lot of weddings lab and said turn of those 33 that i mean how stupid is everybody has stupid over here this thirty-three thousand emails for the yoga yoga and a wedding and they were personal i'll bet you in this room we have people that probably i'm not a big email person you know why i've intelligence i nobody built i'm not a big i don't like him you know what i like i like the old days i like the dates just today they just announced somebody else was hacked and another group was that everybody's being attacked ok they have no idea who's doing it they have no idea is doing it these things are amazing you know the kids growing up i have a young boy bearing he's very smart but he's using the computer so much we put it on lock right no way he can find out i mean i don't know what happened so we go back about an hour later and he's playing with the computer we had another and we said when we had a lock you needed a sequential number and we said baron how did you do that i'm not telling you dead no these kids a genius and it's getting worse and worse because they live with it you know i grew up in there was a certain age they start now they live whether it's like it's like they're right are they can do it so well and i like the old days especially for the military and things like that right you want to attack or you want to do something it's called courier it's called let's put it in a thing put it in an envelope and let's hand it to the general let's not send it over the wires so everybody is probably really good right and no matter how good no matter how good they say it is that it's i mean people can hack it i guess i think it's just terrible and you know if you talk about military you talk about all these secrets and you even talk about politics he talked about all of this stuff it's very confidential stuff and then you find out the hacking is all over the place i year china is brutal they say russia is excellent and you have guys sitting in their home that are very good you have people then and women sitting in their homes that are better than the people that are the inventors and i don't know there's something about you know general douglas macarthur right did have a guy , he says sir here it is that's it the risk is from there to there general george patton i guarantee you general george patton was rough as hell he wouldn't be doing emails when he's gonna be ready to attack if you were around it say i don't like that system at all so thank you darling i love you i i love you i love you and i think it's a guy i mean i don't know who to health care thank you oh oh no it's not beautiful thank you very much thank you very well now i see you i like that much better i appreciate that so thank you yeah i don't know hey the thousands of people in the other side that the fire marshals are being very nice too they don't love me so much right now okay but that's okay and we're going to come over and see them when this is finished should i do that or should i stay with you longer let's go all right welcome up we're going to come over we're going to come over so a lot of things happened that i found last night interest because we're going to get a lot of bernie supporters i think and and bernie made a big mistake the mistake he made and this is the beauty of doing speeches like this because it was late in the night and i saw it and she was thanking bernie and talking about bernie and he's sitting there like plum did you notice no smile his wife pat him on the back and she pulled her hand away with all whoa did you see that a pat on the back garlic i love you and pulls it back and she was a little bit concerned there but he was angry and then a second time they showed him and he was angry and you know what honestly he made a big mistake because we have the best movement of what we have far more people that anybody we have the most important i tell people bill o'reilly said the greatest single phenomena he's ever seen in politics this oh us all of all of us you you all the people outside man that people lined up in the driveway all the way up but but this is one of the great movements in the history of our country our movement is much better than bernie but i'll tell you where bernie blowing he sold his soul to the devil he did he had a great thing i was so surprised because he seemed like a tough guy he was like tough tough tough tough and then in the end he folded and i said yesterday and it's true he wanted to go home he wanted to go to sleep okay that's what but you know had he not folded and his people haven't folded because people were angry now just to show you how unfair it is if that would have happened in the republican convention they would have said catastrophic evening people are screaming did you see when they had the moment of silence for the police and by the way the only reason the police were up on that stage on the fourth night was because i was complaining they don't have any police up there right they put the police up because they were getting a lot of heat but they don't mean it the difference is i mean it okay we're gonna be law and order and i mean it was gonna be great we're going to be but did you see what happened when they had the moment of silence for the police tough situation tough situation not good not good and then you have burning and he makes the deal and then they pick a vice president that's exactly the opposite of bernie ok he believes in tpp which is a disaster by the way we'll never prove it they'll approve it how about where terry mcauliffe the governor of virginia comes out and said don't worry hilary will approve it after the election see that's the way it is and it will take your jobs away almost as bad as nafta which was approved by bill clinton right now after a disaster after has cleaned out so many states in this country i look new york state you look at new york state you look at new england you look at pennsylvania what nafta has done to pennsylvania with these companies moved to mexico a friend of mine is a builder he builds plants plants if you told to build an apartment he wouldn't know where to begin he builds plants big big plans one of the biggest and he maybe i'll use them to build the world what a great idea got a lot of smart people somebody shout shout let it build a wall we will yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we have smart people but this guy bills big big plans to automobile plants and the computer technology plan so that's what he felt some bills goods one of the biggest maybe the biggest one of the bigger and he started out building in the united states years ago and it build plants in the united states so i see him the other day and i say how's it going good how's business unbelievable i see great i thought that was good for the united station i said how many plants your building many he said you've gotta see what's happening in mexico now by the way this guy's better than a consultant if i hire a consultant the highest of guy that you know it's terrible to tell me what's happening right now judge a million bucks i'll give you a report in seven months from now they have to take a long time otherwise they can't judges but yet this guy tells me two minutes in one minute i learned better about what's happening from him talking to him about houses business then i can learn from some phony consultant because if he was any good he would have been the one building the plants right you know so so an amazing thing an amazing thing so i said so what's going on because you got to see mexico the eighth wonder of the world he said we are building the biggest the most sophisticated the most incredible plants all over mexico i say what about the united states not so good like who cares and actually he'd much rather build in the united states but not so good he said not so good and i said what does that mean he said we're doing a little work but not much but donald you have to see mexico i said no thanks but he goes he goes he goes what we're doing there is incredible how stupid are we folks house stupid away our companies are moving to mexico and other places while crooked hillary clinton who is crooked as a three-dollar bill while crooked hillary clinton sits there and makes up stories donald trump didn't do well in his campaign i said i just be 18 people are 17 but with it donald trump no no it was written by all written by its what political talk i can't believe i'm talking about política as politico is terrible to me but political road all clichés not good ok but somebody wrote it she probably didn't notice it but i'm being recognized for having done one of the most legendary campaigns in the history of politics in this country and she puts in her her thing right after the tweet if somebody tweets you get substantial i get upset i don't get upset i don't get upset somebody wrote that you know is a nice little sound by right they just announced they have over 22 million between twitter and face for 22 million people that's like i don't get upset if somebody tweets like i do what i do who cares i think i'll tell you i think i have the best temperament was certainly one of the best temperaments of anybody that's ever run for the office of president ever because i have a winning temperament i know how to win because my whole life i've been winning my whole life i've been winning and i think i have one of the best temperament because we have to start winning first winter we can't beat isis we can't be china in trade and then they go and build this massive fort in the middle of the south china sea with that not supposed to be doing they only do it because they don't respect us so they take our money they take our jobs they take everything they sell us the products no tax come on in our manufacturers want to sell to china they can't get in and if they ever do get in they have to pay taxes so high or they have to build their plants over there and they don't even want him to do that honestly front-month great he said they said well we don't want your product and then they gave a tax rate which i won't even say because it's so high nobody's going to believe it but then they said build your plan tell you but we don't even want you to we don't even want they don't even want us there ok didn't even want to move now boeing they ordered 300 jets and they made boeing build massive plants and watch what happens in seattle and watch what happens in a number of years when those plants are built watch what happens in south carolina where i love those people in south carolina they gave me the biggest victory remember our supposed to live i was supposed to lose highly evangelical but evangelicals love me highly evangelical i one with evangelicals highly military south carolina big military colorado big military big military dig and i went in and you watch what they do south carolina built big boeing plants have a big big plan beautiful i love seeing it i love seeing this actually move part of their operation from seattle seattle big plans so they think it's good new plants everything good great people great labor force paginas forcing them to build plants in china now when china tea values its currency and when boeing and a number of years just remember i said it oh don't worry if i'm president it won't happen they wanna present if i'm president boeing will be very happy believe me because it warn't but they may be unhappy that they built the plant in china but they're not going to have to worry about south carolina in seattle but remember i said it just in case we don't make it because you people get lazy and don't vote ok colorado is very important very important so just remember i said it when that plants finished when they start operating and when china does a massive devaluation of its currency and when you go in order your brand new jet liners for all of the different airlines and when they find out that the planes are going to be made in china not in south carolina and not in seattle not in this country because we have people that are incompetent running our country when you see that and i hope you don't see that because if you see that that means that i didn't win and that won't be good that won't because so here's the story folks when you see that if you see that it'll be a sad day when i told the boeing folks i said to boeing i said you know you have a big investment what happens if the plant that they're being forced to build in china becomes much more active and you start making all of your planes there oh well i don't think that will ever happen watch watch we're dealing with grand masters of currency manipulation one of the reasons among many that i'm against trans-pacific partnership is they don't cover currency manipulation and in fact one of my opponents in politics short very very hard that no currency manipulation be mentioned in the documents this is a us politician i won't mention the name i want me i should but i want yeah the people you know what call washington they'll tell you they didn't want currency manipulation mentioned currency manipulation is the single biggest tool that far in governments use to beat us and to destroy our companies and to destroy our trade and to get rich and to rebuild their countries as we suffer we're like a third-world country we have rotten airports we have airports you go over to dubai you go over to places in china you go over to other places in the middle east you'll see airports the likes of which you've never seen i went to dubai number of years ago and they were treated me great i mean it was great great visit unbelievable what what's happened there but they have an airport that's so unbelievable so the head of the airline is showing me around and it's really good and i'm looking at the terminal i say this is one of the most beautiful and i'm good i mean i'm , i'm a really good builder i built under budget and ahead of schedule by the way i had a meeting with your great newspaper and i really like the editorial board of that this paper okay you know i'm talking about the these are great people and they would tell me there's a veterans administration hospital that had a 1.2 billion dollar cost overrun in this area i don't think of that think of this i'm building a hotel in washington and i'm under budget and ahead of schedule by one year think of it and its peanuts compared to 1.2 billion that what is this that's just a cluster of run and this is happening all over the country when you build a role when you build an airport some of the richest people in this country are people that can't even read or write they're called friends of mine contractors they might not read or write but there are a lot smarter than the guys coming out of harvard i want to tell you they can take them they can take them and wrap them around there though i did an editorial board meeting a little while ago i really like that group of course if they read badly about me i'll take it back okay well we'll be back here again many times you get you get so sick of people and i'll tell you and i'll tell you then i just like that trip ever no i liked him and smart people but they're telling me about a hospital built in the air you know you all know what i'm talking about 1.2 billion i said wow i thought i didn't hear the original into the cost over i said wow that's a lot of money for a hospital how big is it they said no no that's not the course of that that's just the cost overrun think of what we could do if we had real people running our government ok this one there's 1.2 billion and i have friends we know how to build ahead of schedule we build we build buildings they come in under budget they come in head i have friends they can do this if one of the people that i know some new york killer builder or somebody built that building it would have been up two years ago it would have been finished like a year after it started it's not even a tall building that's easy but because it takes longer to build a tall height means length remember that okay but but one of my friends or be doing me the thing would have been thrown up so fast and it would have been better better than it is now tell you a little quick search i got called before the united nations they i heard that we're building an extension to the united nations in new york number of years ago and jeff sessions is such an amazing man and a screen general he was the first senator to endorse donald first really major political guy is very smart guy but they have i built the building across the street like the 320 million dollars and it's a very tall building like around 90 stories tall ok let's talk much taller than the united nations and then it was and i built it for i think it was 325 million times all right condominium is called trump world tower great building beautiful will be all glass it's beautiful herbert new shop at the new york times the architectural critic prior to passing away gave it a great review so we built this building and its immense and i get a call from i think it was the swedish ambassador but one of the investors very good man and he said mr. trump with the united nations on the ambassador again i think it was sweetums while ago said i don't understand something we're talking about doing an expansion of the united nations not a big deal and it's going to cause 1.5 billion dollars i read that you're building which is three times taller or more cause 325 million bones is that possible or is that a mistake i said totally possible mr. ambassador they said why he said to me he's good he's good man but he knew nothing about this business he said why is it that that caused so much less than just a simple expansion of the united nations pillman i said two reasons corruption corruption is number one always number one corruption number one and incompetent number two archer tourist visa so i didn't get a call and i brought before the united states senate to tell the people in the senate because you know where funding the united nations that's another beauty we find nato we find japan we find germany we find saudi arabia we find saudi arabia we pay rent for a base sorry let's pay rent so we can protect them will pay rent they want more rent so we can protect them right so we find saudi arabia we find south korea we have 28 thousand soldiers on the line real world real geniuses i'll tell you so i get called before the senate and they wanted to know and i said look use the storm i then go and i meet the head of the united nations i think there's kofi amount at that time comfy enough and we sit in these two chairs and i'm talking to all of a sudden the curtain opens up and there were massive press taking a picture that's only one he didn't care what the thing calls and then the curtain closed i said okay so it was at that time 1.5 billion dollars and they said to me would you like to meet the man in charge of construction i said i would because how can he spend that much money i you know he's going to teach me there's no way and this guy comes in who didn't know much although he may have known much more than we all think ok so what kind of steam were using you have a boiler plant or using new york state which is different form of energy because i don't know as women you're in charge of the new construction of the building you don't know what kind of steam you don't know what kind of a plant an energy plan to using what are you doing on the curtain world honestly mr. i said are you going are you emptying the building are you gonna do it by floor i don't know i haven't i don't there's a guy judge ok so he was either really bad or really corrupt so that was yet so i offered to do it for i think it was like five five hundred million dollars they said it was a bitch i could save like a billion dollar they said but what will the difference be i say i tell what the difference would be number one it'll be a much higher quality number two will use marble instead of linoleum and number three you don't have to move everybody out of the building and then come back two years later or whatever and not before your number is not a billion five it's going to be many times in i was right about everything that was maybe 8-9 years ago the building cause us watching somebody get so rich we pay for so much of the united nations and by the way here's another one i talked about nikita so five countries that have 28 pay their way the rest of them now and the question was asked is there attacked if they're attacked while the united states come to their rescue meaning one of the country's i said have they pave they said what a horrible question did they go this is hillary clinton don't you know that we have a treaty yeah we do and they have to pay like to write we have to go yeah so so think of it we protect them we protect them they're not protecting us so we protect them against originally the soviet union now russia so we protect them and many of them are paying or they're paying a fraction of what they're supposed to be paying so all i say is i'm i'm fine with a tell you gotta make it more flexible for terrorism ok gotta make it can't have people pay so we're paying a fortune for nato and usually what the press does is they'll say i china and i'm telling you to search for a different reason because our country is broke but we have so much fat out that we could make our country so rich again we can do things that are unbelievable so unbelievable these are just old these are just stories so i was killed on there i gave a great answer what do you think they know it's absolutely i never in all fairness i am a businessperson building buildings and doing things all over the world and i'm doing things and built a great company built a great company and what i'm doing that that's what i'm doing some like nato was not high on my list is that makes sense it wasn't like she was let me tell you everything about nato but i could learn i'm a really fast learner in like 10 minutes i know a lot about nate all right but he answered this question just what i didn't know he's going to talk about me and what do you think about it i said it's obviously number one number two it doesn't cover terrorism which is true and then they will change it right cover terrorism and number three because i heard this that many of the countries aren't paying or aren't carrying their way and everybody the next day they laugh they said he doesn't know foreign policy headlines trump what's your band in nato i don't want to offend him i didn't say that i didn't say that actually the new york times was the only one the cover it correctly which is probably because into the cover anything correct right but drop wants to abandon know then we had japan where we pay more than fifty percent the cost of their defense and we've got the maniac pretty close to him you know north korea and we pay for south korea twenty-eight thousand soldiers on the line we pay and we pay for all these countries and i'll never forget i'm talking about japan i love japan japan graig is a great country that great people have many friends in japan that by my apartment all the time they sell his cars the cars come off like to get it we send them week fair trade they get week we get course their trip ok it comes off like math right like nascar brian france a great brian france of mr. so they come off the boats right they're going 50 miles an hour coming off thats your pin plenty of money so a general gets up to speak and he said mr. trump doesn't understand that japan pays us fifty percent of the cost of their defense fifty percent he was so proud of them so i get a call from one of the newspapers mr. trump general or current older or whatever the hell he was said that japan is paying for fifty percent they actually thought it was good do you have a comment i said yeah why aren't they paying for one hundred percent what what why why and remember you have to be prepared to walk have to always be prepared to walk in 802 with these countries i'm not going we're not going to fit this isn't 40 50 years ago ok we end up in world war three over a country that nobody ever heard of that's attacked ok now if they live up to their obligations is that makes sense but some people say that's a horrible thing to say because of the treaty how i think about japan street so we have a treaty with japan if japan is attacked we have to go with our full force and might and protect japan if the united states is attacked japan doesn't have to lift a finger they don't have to do who makes these nails no seriously who makes these deals ok and we have so many folks i could stay here all day until your stories that you wouldn't believe but here's the story i'm running against a crooked person i'm running against a dishonest person you know she's dishonest when she talks about like my campaign when these guys as much as they can stand me say there's never been anything like this campaign and she's saying about my campaign because somebody wrote it and she was too lazy to correct it that's all i mean it that's all look we're running against a person that was just accused of being negligent and being other things and lying lying how do you lie to the fbi and i mean the answer she lied how do you lie to the fbi and now you're running for president seriously how do you lie to the fbi and now you're running for president how does that happen right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what i've been saying i've been saying let's just beat her or november eight but you know what well don't you know what i'm starting to agree with you i'll tell you tired tired you know it's interesting every time i mention her everyone screams lock her up lock her up lock her up they keep setting and you know what i do i've been nice but after watching that performance last night such lies i don't have to be so nice anymore i'm taking the gloves off right yes thankful for take the gun right taking the gloves all this remember this trump is going to be no more mr. nice guy tell hilary i'm not going to be nice anymore i've been very nice store so you're ready actually some of the folks i defeated they probably would say play he was not very nice left left let me just tell you she is a disaster she talks now change right oh by the way and you saw yesterday so i've been talking we gotta renegotiate after the worst trade deal ever made in the history of our country probably in the history of the world okay you know they just happy so did you see what she said i'm getting criticized this is for months and now yesterday she said we have to start thinking about renegotiating like traitors you never said that she never said that she never said that and by the way she's never gonna do it because she is controlled by the special interest so i spent close to 60 million dollars in my campaign i put up my own money on the primers now i'm spending a lot of money on this but i'm also raising money by the way for the small just go to the republican party and the rnc the republican national committee rights previous is doing a fantastic job but i'm putting up a lot of money to for the general election the last month last spot they said mr job would you put up two million dollars as a match i said yeah okay fine turned out to be three pointers on what the hell happened i said i said how much isn't i think it's 3.8 i don't even know what i don't care what it is because it doesn't matter to me i just want to win we got to win this election but i'm putting up a lot of money for the general we're raising and i'll tell you the beautiful thing we're raising money at 61 dollars i think it averaged in june and we only started toward the middle of the month in june we raced what these seven million dollars in small donations that doesn't happen to a republican so i don't know what number you call republican party goes to the republican party goes to the rnc i don't know what number you call why should i know a thing like that find out and send them some money when you click find out but i'm putting up a lot of money and we're doing great and i see these ads are running against me they're vicious vicious and the false you know the crazy head with megan kelly where they say blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of wherever wherever i was talking about her nose maybe her ears but you know what i wanted to do and does this make sense what i wanted to do is i want to get back onto the question of taxes or economics i said whatever and all of a sudden whatever because these are sick people but really it was nose with the reporter i am i spend so much money on working with the disabled and making my business my buildings accessible millions and millions of them so they have me imitating a reporter because i said that people were dancing in the streets or dancing on the rooftops or something when the world trade center was knocked down right and a lot of people disputed that now all over the world they were a lot of people a lot of reports but pretty sad thing right you got the world trade and thousands of people jumping out of that building and getting killed and you have people that happy about it right so i said dancing rooftop street whatever and we couldn't find too much stuff confirming what i said all of a sudden somebody comes up with an article ok and the article is written by this guy who said he met me many many years ago and the article is a great article for me because it talked about dancing all the thing so i said here's an article i think he was with the washington post when you wrote the article something times washington post but whatever and he wrote this article and it was great i said here's the article and it really showed a lot of people up you know it was it was really sort of pretty much on . not have to present but pretty much on . it was an article but it was an article written by a major newspaper and the author of the article was this guy and they started calling him the press you remember this whole thing does everybody remember they started calling him the press started calling and they're driving like the corner milan and obviously the other side of things started calling them also saying this article is not good because this is sort of confirming what trump is saying they were dancing they were happy that the world trade center was this is not good so all of a sudden the guy and i think by that time the article is almost 15 years old he such changing the article that he made a mistake he this he then i didn't know what he looked like i didn't know that he was disabled i didn't know it i didn't know it at all i had no idea so i started imitating somebody i didn't speak to the guy somebody that was graveling just you everybody know what gravel is gravel is when you do i won't do the act because they'll do a whole big thing i want but at the time i did the act i did the whole thing with groveling and i said he's graveling he said no no the article i was wrong on the article and i was doing a whole big number right i was wrong i promise you i made a mistake when i wrote the article he was graveling grovel grovel grovel right that was the end of it all of a sudden i get reports that i was imitating a reporter that was handicapped i would never do i would never do that it's not in my vocabulary and i spent millions of dollars it's crooked meteor i spend millions so now and i figured that was fine because i would never do but then the guy that wrote the article who by the way james ii article he said he made a mistake and all this stuff right gravel he said but donald trump knows me oh really i don't he met me when i was with i won't even mention them and then just had one of the worst rappers in the world i was used with a different paper real it's going out of business very soon any red so good but let me tell you he met me when i was with another newspaper i think he said in 1988 ok so now we're talking about it was against 2016 were talking 2015 you know whatever this took place 2015 so i met him many years ago and i met a more than once he said not many reporters i make i'd meet guys look at this guy's i meet god i meet so many reporters i meet him they to quote somebody coming out of my ears ok i made so many reporters so they do a commercial truck and hillary and she knew that stuff so they do the commercial like a marking a person with disability i'm not i'm not and by the way i did i certainly didn't have a very good memory i don't remember this guy i wouldn't remember i don't remember reporters that i see him on the phones i see them all over the place they're all over the place reporters but i supposed to remember some guy listen to this i'm supposed to remember some guy from 1988 so he system so they do a commercial hillary issue with the beautiful little children watching as i'm supposedly marking a person with disabilities and i spent millions a year or millions of dollars on ramps and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over and i'm going to mark i would never do that number one i have a good heart number 2 i'm a smart person ok yeah and crooked hillary clinton and crooked dishonest hillary clinton and she knows and crooked hillary clinton put set up and talks about anybody that would mark the disabled i didn't make the disabled number one number two with megan all i did was i want to get back on subject i said because i wouldn't say she's exactly like smith do we agree so i said it was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out and then i said i just want to get back on subject let's go back and talk about taxes i said well wherever so they said because they're deviants deviants they said that blood coming out of it and now they do commercial it's really said they know it's not true they do it anyway i had in mind knows but it could have even been years i didn't think of the other alternative i didn't think so you know it's the first time i've really told that story to those two stories to group did you enjoy that this is not office space did you enjoy so so just to finish up look our country and and he's a sort of creatures because they tell you about how dishonest is that they tell you about the competence like a fire marshal not allowing those people that are in a room to come into this room where we have a little it just tells you it's a disgusting thing but it tells you about honesty it tells you about common sense it tells you that our country has a great future think if we were in the hole as deep as we are and everything was running perfectly right i always like to buy a business that's in terrible shape because if you buy a business in great shape you have nothing to do you can't can we have so many things we can do so our country doesn't win anymore but we're going to start winning again folks okay look at this fall we're going to stop the syrian migrants from coming into the united states we don't know where they come from we don't know who they are and you look all over the world you look at paris you look at what just happened with the priest i'll be loved' priest you look at what's going on all over the world we know nothing about them will build safe zones i'll get the saudis and the gulf states to build safe zones we will run it but they'll put up the money they got plenty of money other people's money you ever hear the opm other people's money and we're going to be so smart we're going to be the smart people if hillary clinton gets in it's going to be four more years of obama and nobody wants four more years of nope will be weak on isis will be weak on the borders will be weak on our military we're going to rebuild that military folks we're going to get it we're not going to be using old aircraft so i just want to tell you i just want to tell you that i'm going to be in colorado alone because because there's no way we shouldn't win this date these are great people heavy military tremendous respect for their police and law and order that's me at the same time we want to treat everybody fairly i mean when things happen we want to make sure everybody does a great job we want to make sure people but we want law and order we want great military we want our vets to be so happy

i was crossing the border but i got here they said mr. trump would be really much easier serve you just didn't speak today and just left and go back immediately to indiana and i said you know we can't let these people down right do we agree we can't do it but i appreciate it but it was fun it was a little different that was a different kind of thing so here's the washington post today the time has come to admit that republican voters want donald trump is their nominee you see that chris good rider good driver that's pretty good so you know where we're making amazing progress all over its it's been incredible last night as you know we had 31,000 people it was and by the way no protesters inside so protest in this morning with no protesters inside but we have 31,000 people and it was just like rocking and everybody loved it was anybody there last night it was it was so incredible we're pretty far away but i'll tell you what it was it was just an incredible evening so what's happened is we started this journey on june sixteenth and it was all about trade because we make the worst trade deals probably ever in the history of any country and then it got down to other things that i talked about i talked about illegal immigration which was a very important subject and has been and because of the fact that i brought it up now people are talking about it now they don't talk about it the way i do we got last week as you know the border patrol 16,500 agents border patrol agents who are phenomenal people who want to do their jobs are told to stand back stand back there standing there these great looking people strong and shape all of the best equipment and they're told to stand back just let everybody come right through the border and they endorsed me 16,500 they've never endorse the presidential campaign and then sheriff joe as you know from arizona endorsed trump and he knows he knows what he's doing he really knows but we have had so many incredible endorsements and now they're coming and i'll tell you over the last two weeks and it took place really even before that but people see what's happening because we have far more votes than anybody else for more delegates in irrya anybody else we're gonna hit that number i think quite easily because you know i i watch and watch the very dishonest media and they say all crews is getting that he's not getting delegates he's getting delegates he's getting second third fourth fifth round he's not gonna be there because we're gonna win the first round we don't even compete for i mean was so far as of today we have 1001 we just broke the thousand mark that yeah and we did fight hard actually in pennsylvania because in pennsylvania i won in a landslide we got i guess over sixty percent of the vote and that's pretty hard when you have three people running you know when you get sixty percent with new people you win in a landslide right that's called and said when you have three people and you get practically sixty percent and then in the other states you know we had five and we did unbelievable numbers up to sixty-six percent and it's been amazing we had grilled island where delaware connecticut and maryland pennsylvania and we did great pennsylvania a little thing that if you win you get 17 so i got the 17 and the rest you have to fight for it said what kind of a deal is in other words you have to take him out to dinner and there's a wonderful hotel i'm sure your lunch is good but they don't take a beer they take him - very fancy restaurants they bring them to hotels perhaps they put him on yachts and take him for a cruise they basically have to bribe the delegates and it's not the right system you know we have a system where it's like democracy works supposed to be voting and it's terrible and fortunately we have a great republican leader in in pennsylvania he's he's a really fair guy and i really really something and there's also a morals clause they take you know what and i've heard this for a couple of years with the delegates in pennsylvania of you win there's a moral obligation that you supposed to vote for the one who wins which sort of makes sense right and you know i refuse to say in this room because i say it outside and i get standing ovations but this is a room i want to it but it's a rigged system it's a rigged system ok it's a horrible horrible disgusting system and you know i see this bernie sanders i'm not a fan of bernie sanders by the way but i see that he's you know wins a lot of wins a lot never has a chance of winning he's had a streak where you were about ten in a row and every time you watch the pundits said say we can't when he's it's done you know its weight behind because they have a thing called super delegates well ours is more sophisticated because you don't know how badly rigged it is ok with the super delegates it's obvious you know the handle all the super-delegates and by the way do i look forward to beating her do we look forward to winning do you know what i mean if she but you know she's allowed to have she was allowed to run this is a big question what she bail and personally think she's being protected by the democrats and she'll be allowed to run but we'll see what happens so what we've done is we've really i mean we won new york with 60 almost sixty-two percent of the vote which was unprecedented and got almost a hundred percent of the delegates of 95 delegates we got a moment stall and then the next week we had the five and we want them all in landslides and actually a lyin ted you know you're doing and i think we have a couple of friends but lyin ted did not do too well in new york post you know randy's hovering around the ten percent mark you gotta do better than that if you're going to collect all these delegates of the second battle how would you like to be in a position where you're in we're in cleveland and we're having the whole deal and it's going fine and for some reason and don't worry about it we get it i think we have it easily but for some reason it goes to a second ballot and somebody on the second ballot because they want in delegates who has 5 million less votes because by the time we finish and were scheduled to do very well in california i guess you've seen them but really well they're really well last fall i so i'm at forty-nine percent which is great and there's a lot of like twenties and the 19 or something but we're doing well i don't even say it because you got to go out of work especially by people sitting in this section they gotta work what are we just pretend we're tied ok and that is a problem and i've seen it i've always all my life i've dealt with politicians and somebody will come into my office the best politicians they come into my office and they said donald i say how you don't i'm tied and he always is uptight and then he went by 25 points but he said he has to motivate himself by saying is tied even sometimes says i'm losing donald but i'm going to win but we have picked up so many votes over the last period of time and in fact i was just watching the network's today and have a chart that i think it's already happened but in the his tree of primaries republican primaries i've gotten the most votes in the history of the republican party right and we haven't even hit some of the big we haven't even hit some of the big states yet which is sort of an amazing thing so so we're really on a path that's incredible and yesterday i thought ted did something which was really quite good it was record-setting it's never happened before in the history politics he has no path to victory it's impossible for him to win with the votes the only way he can possibly win is if things go terribly wrong and he goes through the back door and he bought all of these delegates and i will never use the word bribe i would never use a word like bride so if he bribed the delegates but i don't call brunt but and then think of this think of your the rnc and writes was a good man by the way and jim is a good man the gym do a good job was jump where is jim he did such a great job you know he called me said mr. trump would you do me a favor would you take maybe 10 15 pictures i said absolutely gym so i'm just coming through dirt and mud and under fences so you all walk through the lobby i go under fences i'm coming through i'm looking at myself i'm trying to get all the dust and everything off and the 20 people that he told me about turned out to be about what six seven hundred people my hand i'm shaking hands shaking pictures taking it so that's why he's a great leader right jim it going i i hope they paid a lot of money jim but knowing the history of the republican party there's never been anything like this and then what ted did and and yesterday in indiana which is an incredible place with incredible people bobby knight the great bobby knight and joyously how get how good is that and he's gonna be with the old sunday and monday and where we are having a good time he's some guy he's a winner you know that's what we need them we need winners we have to win our country doesn't win anymore and we have to win we have to win but chris is something that i've never seen because he picked a vice-presidential person carly he picked carly who and i like carly but you know when she left she had no votes which she won jim was she wonder what shes 0 but you have the votes and you know what maybe it's a good move enough i'll let you know about a month all right i don't think so but the worst move was making a deal with kasich so they make this deal i get a call two days ago from a number of people and we have to do a pr statements 1145 and evening they said all mr. trump what happened they merged who kasich and cruz i said they did i said that's a good thing it shows total weakness it shows illegal collusion you know in business you get put in jail politics you can do anything you want right i said but it shows such ineptitude and such weakness and what's the deal the deal is that crews will take indiana and kasich and now he's sitting there eating you know he's eating doing a news conference and piling pancakes into his now i never saw anything like my son said my little boy bear and he said daddy that that's disgusting i never saw many like that i've never seen a man eat while he's doing the news conferences i've did you ever see him do a news conference without eating so these two guys formed an alliance because i think of it i've been doing this for nine months i'm so honored and you have these two politicians have been doing it sort of all their lives right i mean kasich approved after which by the way emptied out you state i hate to tell you that every state but kasich and cruz is fine with the chinese money manipulation he's going to allow that to happen can't do that because that's how they're killing us evaluation of their money and their currency is killing absolutely killing this country not only china but many other places you can't allow it he wants to allow it so there are a lot of things going on now you why you want to know why he wants to allow it i just asked the donors as the special interests as the people because believe me i've seen deals that are made and these deals are the the politicians are very smart you'd be amazed what a lot of people ask me how come they do these things and it's largely because of the donors and the special interests and i'm self-funding my campaign so that's a big big difference okay nobody's gonna tell me what to do but they form this alliance and already like the next morning is formed everyone's sake big deal they formed they formed it to be the guy that's been a politician for nine months ok me and after is formed it's all done and kasich and answers no i want people in indiana to vote for me that wasn't supposed to be the deal they were supposed to vote for cruz here and in oregon which i by the way poll just kidding i'm killing everybody in oregon i'm killing which is an amazing place but in a couple of other places that's kasich so you know they're working the system that that's what i said it's rigged right rig so they work in the system and about 10 hours goes by and kasich announces essentially he's not doing the deal and then crews today so daughters no do this is a politician's folks they can't make a deal how are they going to deal with china how are they gonna do it so so we have now a big yeah i think a big moment coming up in indiana and we feel very good about it we'll see i mean because i think i think that deal with such a disaster as soon as i heard it i said that's the end of them both of them amy kasich has one he's 1 4 48 442 doesn't matter when you add that whether it's 40 i guess it's 42 but he's that includes islands but he's 1 4 42 and if you think about it dr. ben carson who is an incredible guy who endorsed me by the way was doing much better then was doing much better than kasich and if you think about it chris christie was doing better marco rubio has more delegates right now and he left a month ago and he still has more delegates and and others others these people could have hung in for a much longer period of time and who knows i mean you know based on this theory it's a little like a spoiled child i don't care mom i'm staying here i'm not leaving no it's it's like ridiculous what's going on so bottom line is he is staying in which some people say it's good for me i actually would rather have them get out but crews will then have to get out also because he doesn't have it you know it doesn't have the votes oh it's coming to an end i think it's going to come to an end very soon and really and i speak to the people in this room because there has to be unity in our party it has to be you and if they're not it's going to be if there's if there's not unity and i mean really good solidarity unity relationship friendship we have people like jim where they do such a good job all over the country we have some great people but there should be and there has to be unity now with that being said would i win can i win without it i think so to be honest i think so because they're going to vote for me they're not voting for you know jeb bush didn't support you big deal like i care ok i heard about television yesterday low energy very low energy right now i heard about you i would say this but i saw him under one of the shows that yesterday i i do not consider him a conservative who folks i'm a conservative but at this point who cares we gotta straighten out the country and we give me a break and a couple of the shows were saying that today i mean look i am a conservative i'm very conservative on a lot of things and i'm actually very conservative and trade a lot of the conservatives you know the genius is that that have absolutely no they have high iq and no brain power they sit back and they say free trade i see free trade - i love free trade the problem is our leaders are not smart people or are leaders are taken care of by the special interests and lobbyists you know all the people with the money the campaign people and we're not making good deal and when you have china with a 500 billion dollar-a-year trade deficit and when you have mexico with a trade deficit of fifty eight billion dollars i say by the way we'll build a wall the wall is going to cost ten billion dollars it's real easy to figure when we have a trade deficit with mexico of fifty eight billion dollars it's really really easy to figure out of that and when i get off the debate stage a couple of months ago one of the folks came up they said you're not really going to build a wall i said yeah actually it's really easy and i always talk about you know i always build a wall i always talk about china 2,000 years ago they built a wall that's thirteen thousand miles love we have a wall well we actually need its 2,000 miles but we actually only need because of natural barriers we only need a thousand month so they 2,000 years ago they could do 13,000 today we can't do without it so he says you can't build a wall it's so easy oh i can just see that beautiful precast plank well good solid foundations nice and high make this ceiling look like a little low ceiling boy if anybody gets up there they're gonna say man where do we get down see the way they go over our little fences these guys are amazing they climb over it's like it's not even there they go through it over if they go not going to happen with this what with what we're gonna do but we have to do it and by the way we want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally folks otherwise we don't have a country we are not so so we have to get together as a party because it's a tougher road the presidency for the republicans i don't know if people talk about this but it really is it's a tougher road for a republican that it is for a democrat the road is tougher it's it's not as easy and you really have to pick somebody that knows what's happening that's really really good i accept the position on molly and i'll bring things into play that nobody else is going to bring as an example in new york is big i wanted with landslides numbers i beat everybody by what 38 points or something like that the second place and much more than let's see if cruz got like 12 and if i got 60 tool does that mean i beat him by like 50 points and that he's gonna run and represent us because he got those delegates to go on the second to give me a break so here's the thing here's the thing we bring new york into play now you to new york no republican if i except for me no republican will go to new york to campaign ok no republican will go to michigan to campaign republicans will never beat hillary in florida i will you said one florida and i'll answer i'll win pennsylvania most republicans will never win pendants to probably don't like any republican can win pennsylvania so i'm going and this is you know they cover this and now by the way the polls are coming out where i'm leading or even with hillary you don't hey i had fit and i wrote this look i had this listen to this 55,000 negative ads as if two months ago now it's up to exactly sixty thousand negative events and then i watched like asa call you he does great again so he did have one ad give him about for ads and he goes down like a rock ok same thing with cruise but now the polls are coming out where i'm even you saw him there all now i'm even one has to be up but they even i don't want to even be up right now it's just going to be i just look so forward to doing it you know i started i started with 17 people right 17 were actually 18 if you include gilmore did anybody get that so let's say there were 18 i mean they were so we had 18 people we have 17 people that i had to be one by one and when i first came in they said you know the geniuses back here brilliant guys they get paid for doing nothing so so what happens that's a krauthammer he won't run how about this karl rove is he the dumbest human being on earth he still thinks romney won the election i'm telling you romney won remember him no no romney 15 million votes behind he's going to make a comeback but we're up to ninety eight percent no no romney won these are the people you gotta go you gotta go different way folks because these people are leading you right into the middle of a very bad bad desert and we're gonna win but the truth is we're going to win in a way that nobody seen before we're going to win so strong we're going to be so strong we're going to be so smart again ideally we're going to be together i think i will win even if we're not together i mean there's some people i honestly don't want their endorsement i just don't want it you know i've watched all my life as a politician they just just kill each other right they hate each other with a passion they say the worst things about each other they say things that you could never say and recover and one loses one wins and then they say at the end right you know after i want to congratulate jimmy around a brilliant campaign and i want i will be behind him one hundred percent he's a great person a great man and send myself they were saying the worst things well things get said he is the difference like like with ted cruz is a wonderful guy i don't want it i mean if you want to address me that's fine but i don't care does that make sense to you a guy like bush i watched him yesterday on television listen you're not kidding me did you want to endure swing who knows i don't care it's not going to have any impact on whether or not we beat hillary clinton not going to have any impact but most of the party has to come together and the smart people in the party have to come together and we have smart people we have really smart people so we're going to hopefully close this thing out fairly soon i think that you know now that we cracked the 1000 number which is great right now its face you know it's interesting though i'm up by four hundred or so delegates i'll be up by more than 500 when it's over and we'll be up by five million votes okay and we're gonna break this this coming week we break the all-time record and we'll break the all-time record by probably four million votes i mean it's nobody's ever seen anything like this it's a movement it's a great movement many many people have come on to the republican side many many people it's something that they're talking about all over the world i've been on the cover of time magazine numerous times this year all because of the move not me it's because of the movement and what's going to happen is going to be so special we have to come together we have to pick our nominee we have to go out and do what we have to do and i'm telling you you are going to have an unbelievably good result in november i started with 17 people governor's senators people of accomplishment some people of great accomplishment and every week bo bom bom and believe me i knocked him off i not come and every week boom we're down to 16 we're down to 14 we're down to 12 we're down to eleven and then i get 11 people and i'd win a state and i have thirty-seven percent of the vote with 11 people and these morons would say but he didn't break 50 how to help you break 50 when you have 11 people and their governors and senators and now i'm breaking 15 by mp you know what i probably would have had a tea if you gave me the most popular guy out of the 11 or 14 that are left give me the most popular person and i probably would have had a t20 but you can't do it when you have that many people so now even though we have three were into the sixties that's that's sort of an amazing number but i just want to tell you you people have been fantastic on jun 7 you have a big big day because the world is gonna be watching world is watching pretty much every tuesday but and this next tuesday in indiana where i'm going now it's going to be a biggie but i will tell you and those people are incredible people and they want to see really they want to see something that's going to be so they want to see victory they want to see bobby knight you know they want to see victory and that's why i was so great getting his endorsement because i love people that when and we're going to start winning again we don't win any more and by the way i can add something the republican party in a presidential sense doesn't when any more you picked your standard cookie cutters i can tell you already just give me the name of the person and i'll tell you exactly what state she's going to win and what state she's going to lose i'm different because i'm going to win states that nobody else can and when i can focus on hillary as i say crooked hillary one i focus on hillary he'll go down easier than any of the people we just beat so i just want to thank everybody i know they're waiting they're going to take me under offense through a field oh you have no idea the route they have planned for me to get out of here but i love you folks and jim i want to thank you and joel and everybody i want to thank you all thank you folks go out remember welcome to the next president of the united states donald j trump for those who abandon hope will restore hope and will welcome them into a great national crusade to make america great again i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created we begin with breaking news our nbc news decision desk has confirmed the donald trump has reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the republican nomination for president the american dream instead but if i get elected president i will bring it back girl has better and stronger than ever before as we will make america great i guess we are going to make our country great again we're going to take our country back from these people we're gonna take it back ladies and gentlemen the next president of the united states donald trump yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you very much everybody all i knew they had these teleprompters i would have used them i'm starting to love those teleprompters you know it's interesting it's much easier when you have a teleprompter and i'm getting great reviews with the teleprompters when you stand up and you just go at it it's much more exciting however i want to tell you i think i think this crowd i know i know the folks from colorado and they're wild i think if i used the teleprompter with this grad be out of here fast it so let's get out of here so i just want to thank this is a tremendous crowd we really appreciate it set up pretty quickly well so colorado it taught me a lot about politics i learned a lot because holes came out that i was gonna win colorado and doing really well in colorado and look good and i was looking forward to it and then all of a sudden i didn't get the delegates i said but what happened to the vote remember and i started to learn you know quick learner i'm a quick learner but that was an amazing a week you remember that and we have some of you folks probably we're out there with a little picketing a little of craziness and i think they'll probably ended up changing i think they're going to change it next year and i think you're gonna go out and actually vote and and that's a good thing that's a good thing so you see what's happening and i always say the system's rigged it's wrecked and it's rigged against the people it's not rigged for the special interests and lobbyists are people that want certain things i used to be one of them once i said i'm running all of a sudden i was like an outsider big outsider but i'm glad i did it because you know what we have we have a movement going on like they haven't seen maybe ever in this country according to what the pundits are saying and i tell i tell the story where numerous people bill o'reilly not so long ago a few weeks ago said it may be the single greatest political phenomena that i've seen in my lifetime he's talking about his lifetime and i said wow that's a lot of phenomena as you've seen but numerous other people have said it too and here we we stand and there you stand and sit oh you're able to sit that's good see we supply cheers how many people do that nobody else applies chairs nobody else does that only trump only truck that's good these lights are so bright i can hardly see who's that that's a good crowd of people wow it's broke and thank you thank you very much but the system is rigged and you know we went through the primary system and we did have problems here because you know wasn't a vote and somebody said i did really well in the polls and as soon as they saw how well i did in the polls they went to a delicate system where they just too . the delegates and it's all right it all worked out well it all worked out well you know what in the end it doesn't matter here we are right doesn't matter and you have some terrific people in the state very smart very good and they gotta really be helping us in november and before november but i know i know how hard they're working in colorado and we're gonna we're gonna have tremendous i think we're gonna have a tremendous victory here a couple of things before i before i really before i really get going colorado nra they're like synonymous the nra endorsed me we're going to save your second amendment a hundred percent we're saving his second remember and and i have to tell you the nra these are terrific people that terrific people they love the country and they take a lot of heat and they don't have the easiest job i will tell you but they love the country wayne and kris and all of the other people i've met from the nra and they gave me i think the earliest endorsement they've ever given under these circumstances and they gave me a very early endorsement i was very honored by but i've gotten to know him and they love our country ok they love the second amendment but they love our country so you have to remember that about the nra because what they do is not easy not easy and they're saving the 2nd amendment for you so just remember that and i'm going to be representing them very well in that regard the other that we have to talk about is the evangelicals have been so amazing to me we had an event the other day in new york right and evangelicals in the room many evangelical but we had an event and ben carson called me who was a great guy will of ben carson and he called and he said you know donald i'd love you to get with the evangelical leaders and christian leaders all throughout the united states not a big deal it'll take you maybe 15 or 20 minutes but maybe you could see them and maybe you know i think it's a good thing for you to do now i've one with evangelicals in many many of the states in the south carolina nevada and like all over the place we've had great great success the south alabama arkansas all of and we've had unbelievable relationships and unbelievable success but ben wanted me to do it as you know when ben got out and he did really well it was tough he was a great competitor he did really really well when he ran and he got out and he called me and he said you know i love what's going on you have a movement going on this isn't like a normal think there's a movement i would love to endorse you i said ben i would love to have your endorsement plenty of people are calling saying we want to endorse you and it's never been that important to me i will say this bobby knight in indiana was important right bobby knight was important but they said i said i'd love to ensure that he comes up and he goes you know i'd love to meet now it's not a big deal maybe a hundred and fifty maybe 200 people and they could be here in a month in new york but it would be a great thing so all of a sudden the time comes and my people come in they say mr. trump you won't believe it it's packed they said i believe it because it's always back but the largest group of clergy ministers pastors evangelicals christians the largest group they've ever had by far over a thousand and they wanted to know could we take two to three hours so this was the 50 been is one of the greatest salesman i know right he said small group 15 minutes turned out to be a large group three hours but it was an amazing event it was an amazing and i learned but it was just an incredible group of people franklin graham was there and jerry falwell jr from liberty college is a fantastic guy and has so many people friends real friends ralph reed we've had so many friends and people that have really been helpful to me and i as an example liberty college everybody goes through liberty college and we all make a speech have one of the most beautiful auditorium is one of the most beautiful colleges i've ever seen actually and one of the most incredible auditoriums and it holds at 12,000 people something like that and i have the all-time record for attendance which is really important i got that two years ago and i said is it still intact i said yes and i broke it this time i said good that's cloud and they had closed circuit television because the room was too small even as big as it was in all the classrooms all over the school that closed circuit television and we had an amazing time and to get the support and everybody went there i think every candidate went there and because of what it represents such importance and what happened is in the end jerry calls he said you know i want to endorse you and that had such a huge impact because he's so respect her the school is so respected the college the universe so respected and getting jerry support was such a great thing for me so i just wanted to thank him but i wanted to thank everybody because that was an amazing day we had about a week ago in new york city it was packed and it was full of love i will tell you that it was full of love so we'll talk for a little while about what's going on i'm going to tell you some of the ideas that we want to have i wrote down some notes in the plane because because i didn't know i had this last standing up here fact it says right now number one number two that's not meant for me i want to thank sarah palin for being here because sarah sarah strong well sarah sarah is a special person and sarah's another one where it came out of the blue and she liked what i was saying and she was also close with many of the other people that were running and the word came back to me that sara was very interested and we called her and i can tell you they were very very disappointed people that i was running against on the republican side i'm talking about and they were very very disappointed when sarah when sarah came out from me i'll tell you that was a that was a big event and she's so loyal and so amazing and her family is so amazing her husband's an incredible guy and for her to come here again and and just say hello to you folks is just really something special so i really appreciate that sarah palin was able to come so i wrote some notes they're us you sarah has a big group we do love sarah right look at that wow i'm not i'm not surprised if a good and for good and for good reason by the way so i want to give you some of the goals just quickly and easily and you'll understand what they are but you know the other night on television i was looking and certainly terrorism's actually number two i was surprised it will probably be number one pretty soon because what's going on today in israel there was a horrible killing and then there was another horrible killing in oregon and there was another one i mean it's going it's going what's going on now is unbelievable people that shouldn't be allowed in people that shouldn't be here and we're gonna have strong borders folks we have strong borders we're gonna have the wall and we're going to let people come into our country that should come into our country and they're going to come into our country legally going to come in illegally and we wanted to come but they're going to come into our country legally but one of the things i noticed because it was on one of the networks where they had him listed in order and actually they had the economy number one and i'm number one on the economy that's good and in fact rasmussen just came out with a pole yesterday afternoon and trump is number 1 i'm up four points can you believe as long as it's not we're gonna do very well we're gonna do you know the primer is a one after one being being bong being and people said what happened just one after another and you know we have the right message and i'm just the messenger i'm doing a good job as a message i will say okay but i'm just the best in people it's what i'm saying it's what i'm saying about what's going on and it's getting stronger i think the message is getting stronger we're being destroyed by trade which we'll talk about were being destroyed at our borders which we'll talk about and we're allowing people to come into our country from syria and other places that should be allowed to come into our country we have no idea who they are where they're from we have no idea what's going on they have no paperwork they have no documentation they could be isis i used to say they're probably not but now i say many of them probably are you see what's happening in germany you see what's happening in sweden you see what's happening in some of these countries where they're taking them in it's a nightmare and i have a bigger heart than anybody or as big as anybody in this room and i will tell you i will tell you we're gonna do we're gonna do safe zones in syria we're going to get other people to pay for them the gulf states have a lot of money people don't ask them to pay trump is going to ask him to pay you have to pay and and we'll get it done believe me we'll get it done so one thing i just wanted to say we're going to repeal and replace obamacare health care was the third was third on the list and honestly i was surprised to see it healthcare on this list was the economy it was terrorism and was health care which tells you something you know in texas they go through blue cross blue shield they had a sixty percent increase you're going to have an increased like you've never seen before november for us now they're trying to delay the increase till after the election we can't let that happen because this increase is an election changing increased i hope we don't need we don't even need them but this is an election changing increase that you're going to get i'm hearing numbers like higher than the numbers in texas so sixty percent in texas going through blue cross blue shield got the obamacare sixty percent increase think of it thank you it unimaginable well it's all so horrible because your premiums are going up your deductibles are through the roof and unless you die a really really severe long-term death you're not going to use it because your deductibles are so high deductibles are through the roof and people don't even get to use it so they're paying more than ever and they don't get to use and we're going to change that with a repeal and replace obamacare and we're going to get something so much better and so much less expensive ok i already talked about the fact we're going to save the second amendment right that's a biggie we're going to eliminate job-killing regulations are regulations in this country are killing we're gonna have massive tax reform and simplification a big lowering of the taxes the biggest of anybody by far hillary clinton is raising your taxes she's raising your taxes substantially and it won't be simplification we're lowering attacks as you watch what's going to happen with the economy we're lowering your taxes big league and tremendous simplification we're lowering business taxes we're going to allow money we have trillions of dollars outside of the united states owned by really the the corporations have this money they can't get it back into the country and everybody agrees republicans democrats that you come back in they can't make a deal that's a deal that would take five minutes sitting around the room but nobody there's no leadership so we have trillions of dollars who would not want to make that deal they say two and a half trillion i say it's over five trillion but whatever it is its massive and company's corporate inversion companies are leaving the united states because taxes are too high but they're also leaving to get their money they can't get their money back in so they leave to get their money so it's crazy we're going to appoint supreme court justice is who you're going to be very happy such a big thing and these are justices that will uphold the constitution of the united states and fully up hold it right and you know what's going to happen and ag i said get a kick you have these people look it was a tough campaign it was a brutal campaign some of the people that do this professionally said it was the most brutal campaign in the history of politics in this country i don't know if that's true or not but we started off with 17 people and there were a lot of bad things said and there was one person that came out and i understand you know i understand but they were really nasty to me and i was really nasty to them and some of them just can't understand the importance of a victory or the republicans and one of the best things we can say of the judges because you know we could talk about the strong military to do all of the things but the judges we're going to appoint at least three you have scalia who is great and he's who would have thought that was going to happen that was it going to be for many years and all of a sudden justice scalia was gone so you have that one before you start and then you probably have two more you could even have three and you could even have four more i mean frankly it a lot probably going to be a record in the history of this country for a president could have as many as you could have including justice scalia you could have as many as five probably will have three but that's the difference between having our country is a great country and having venezuela ok and you see what's happening over there believe me where they're fighting over love spread in the street i mean that's a tremendous thing and what i did because i i've only been doing this for 12 months so what i've done fact they said one of the articles had it was two hundred and eleven years of experience you know they ended up everybody there are two hundred eleven years versus 11 months and look at one is that good i mean don't we get credit i think experience is a great thing but i think we're getting tired of the experience because the experience was it working for us right but because of the fact that i haven't been out there as a politician people know me but i haven't been out there is a politician a lot of people have said to me senator sessions who is a fantastic man and others they said it wouldn't be bad and i actually went in with the idea because i was getting criticized they said well what happens if he appoints judges that we don't like so i went to the federalist society which is sort of the gold standard now hillary clinton said the gold standard of trade deals his teepee now she's taking that back you son right when you mentioned tpp will destroy you folks that will destroy it will take any vestige that we still have left in our country it will destroy you and she said it now what happened is when she heard me being very critical of it she realized that was right so she said now she's against it but she's going to approve it in two seconds if she ever won and that will be as bad or worse then after which was by the way signed by her husband okay so okay so i went out and i said you're not going to do i'm going to pick 10 judges or 11 judges and we'll see what happens and i picked 11 gotten from the federalist society run through by a lot of great politicians that i know that are highly respected senators and congressmen great people and loved went through heritage was great jim demint and the group was a great guy jim is a great guy we like jim listen you people wow he is a great guy that we ran them through heritage and these are 11 people i think i'm going to pick for more so i'm 15 and i'll pick from that list for people like that exactly like and we're gonna have great judges and it had a big impact but you still have people out there and it's just one of those things you know one of the things i'm most proud about is that in the history of the republican party with 17 people running i had the most votes of anybody that's ever run in the primers we had almost 14 million taken 1 37 states next time is going to be colorado by the way colorado is not in that 30 several don't worry if it was i'd still be here today but what we have 37 states and we had the largest number of us have when you think about it almost 14 million votes and and it wasn't even close ronald reagan who we love you have the bushes you have a white the eisenhower richard nixon everybody you have everybody just so much more than anybody else wasn't even close but think of it they would run against two people one person for people when you break that record and you're running against 17 very capable people that's really a record that is pretty amazing more amazing than even just one so i was very i was very honored by the we're going to protect our country from terrorism okay folks we are going to protect our country from terrorists we are going to be so tough we are going to be so smart and so vigilant and we're going to get it so that people turn in people when they know there's something going on like in san bernardino people so bombs all over these people's floors it bombs all over the floor hey george people saw and they talked about racial profiling and profiling we didn't want to turn them in because we didn't want to get accused of profiling give me a break you know what that is that's a lawyer telling them listen you better say that because otherwise you're in big trouble but people have to turn people in and if they don't turn them n we're gonna have so many of these things what happened in orlando is disgraceful disgraceful that a thing like that can happen and then they don't want to mention what happened we have a president that doesn't want to mention what really happened it's called radical islamic terrorism right that's what happened and you have crooked hillary clinton that didn't want to mention it either but we shamed her into it but she still hasn't mentioned it she said i will say and then she didn't quite use the expression the way it should be but i will say radical islam i will say okay but she's devastated she said she will say because we shame director just like we shamed her into going against tpp was that's not the only reason she didn't do it she'll do it but not for the election because people are sick and tired of being ripped off with our jobs leaving our state's with our jobs leaving our country with the money they get the money they get the jobs we get nothing we get unemployment that's what we get we get unemployment and no taxes and folks we can solve that situation so easily that situation is so easily sell i've been watching for a long time and i've been watching it very very closely how the government is trying to stop jobs from leaving our country i left yesterday new hampshire where i see building after building just got wiped down new england one of the worst places in terms of that upstate new york a disaster pennsylvania a disaster maryland connecticut all states that i want in massive numbers when i had a series of states five or six states in a row where we've been devastated tremendous we have and i but i've been much much tighter so we're going what colorado we gotta win the go to illinois i'm gonna spend time in illinois and spend a lot of time in michigan i think when i've been talking about cars moving to mexico car companies ford moving to mexico for two years long before i even knew we'd be in this position nobody has been better to the state of michigan and to the car industry than me in terms of what i'm saying and what i'm going to do to get the car companies back number one and to keep them from moving because they're going to continue to move like you've never seen before if i don't win we're going to have job loss like you have never seen ever before if i don't want so i think we're gonna play great in michigan even in connecticut there was a poll that came out this is a state that i love have so many friends that live in connecticut but this is the state that a republican or traditional republican would never spend one afternoon in terms of getting votes and i'm going to spend a lot of time in connecticut and we may even give a shot to new york in california because we have tremendous guys were getting 30 35 thousand people going to these places so we're gonna we're gonna play we're going to play in a lot of states that normally obviously ohio and pennsylvania and florida those are your states that everybody says you have to win you have to win but i think we have a lot more leeway than anybody else running for office from the republican party and i think we're going to do great in these places we want to uphold totally up hold the rule of law not being upheld not being okay we want to cut down on the unbelievable crime it's pouring in and the crime rate generally ok we want to keep our children safe we want to keep ourselves safe but we have to we have to so many friends of mine jameel as an example shaw his son was killed by a person that came into this country and the illegal immigrant should have never ever been here kate as you remember from san francisco shot viciously by somebody that was sent out of the country five times and we'll probably get off i see the lawyer and this thing oh maybe it wasn't i am enough it's terrible it will go on for years and years and years what happened to kate and so many others so many others and we're going to have a country where we can be free to walk around and free to walk the streets and free to look at the beautiful golden gate bridge with your father like cape was doing and then shot from nowhere with an have a country that's going to be safe again just remember that we're gonna have a country that's going to be safe and we're not going to play games we're not going to be politically correct perhaps we're going to have a country that's gonna be sent we're going to make our government so important responsible to the people not to the special interests of special interest control your government funds the special interest i mean you see what happened today where bill clinton goes in the other day into an airplane just happened to be oh just a coincidence you know he just happened to be at the airport at this time think of it just happened to be at the airport you know when i first heard the story i said no no you're kidding i don't believe it i thought somebody was joking but it's not a joke it's not a joke it's a very serious thing and to have a thing like that happen so say it and as you know hilary is so guilty she's so guilty then you can read them right off here and how that's not being pursued properly and and i think that he really i think you really opened it up he opened up a pandora's box and it shows what's going on and it shows what's happening with our laws and with our government but if you think that he just happened to be at the airport because nobody really and he may have and honestly he may have left and gone someplace but it seems like he's talking about golf and grandchildren i love my grandchildren so much but if i talk about him for more than about nine or ten seconds you know what are we i love my grandchildren i love that when i love that when i love love love that one and look at the beautiful i love these kids after that what are you going to say right i love those kids they're the great eight i love i love my children i love my children my children are going to be speaking at the convention the children are all going to be speaking ivanka tiffany don erik there they're going to be speaking my wife is going to be speaking at the convention we're gonna have we're gonna have a great time and then you have to talk about golf of the rest of the time and you know i love golf but after talking for a couple of minutes it's hard to talk about it much longer than and above all what we're gonna do so important we're gonna put america first i have to say it we don't put america things we don't put a moment we don't put american and we have to so when we look at what's going on in our country and what we see all of the mistakes that are being made and we see all of the corruption and all of the horrendous politicians and by the way i have to tell you some great politicians - i've met some people that are great people is a great people and they love the country and they're there for the right reasons but you meet so many that aren't you just meet so many that aren't and we do deal in a rigged system to rig system and i learned so much during the primaries i want as an example i one in new orleans i went to make a speech louisiana i was in new orleans mint a speech i then went into louise inflow flew into the airport in louisiana there's this massive hanger and it was the night before the election and i gave a speech and it was just we had so many thousands and thousands of people the airport to the hangar was packed it was a massive problem probably three times four times bigger than this room it was packed that was the night before the election i said how could i lose my list and i didn't lose i want and i wasn't expected to win you know what a lot of things that i wasn't expected to do and i won easily but i want and and everything was good and then about two weeks later they're showing delegate counts to me so are you did this you did this you did that is it is good what about this one that's wrong because i one that's a right yes sir you did but i have less delegates than the people that lost and that's when i realized is rigged folks it's rigged but i got smart fast i got smart fist when i got smart very fast and one of the things that we're going to focus on and we're going to focus on more than almost anything because you know look we need safety we need borders we're gonna have the wall were building the wall and the wall is necessary and we're gonna have a great relationship with mexico gonna be very important but we're gonna build the wall thanks it was going to pay for the wall you understand that don't know they're going to pay for the world and we're gonna have trade and we're gonna have lots of good things happen with mexico mexico doesn't like us right now mexico doesn't respect our leaders remember sergeant amber ec remember they couldn't get him out of prison right gregor was very helpful i think i was helpful least i help them but but couldn't get him out and he was there for a long time long long time and one of the meanest worst prisons in the world they say horrible place we couldn't get him out shoulda got math i'm not sure the president even made a phone call i will tell you something when things like that happen if i'm president i know they say oh it's not presidential you shouldn't do that but things like that happen if i'm president i promise you i'll be making phone calls folks i'm going to be doing when i'm not i'm not really sure that he ever even made a phone call certainly there was no rush it's sort of like the horrible deal that we made with iran iran has become a power we have made over the last few years over between hillary clinton and john kerry who made it was one of the worst negotiators i've ever seen how bad he goes out and he breaks his leg in a bicycle race can you believe this he's in the middle of negotiating with you and he's got all this stuff on he's got all deal the company's all deal the helmet got everything done i promise you i swear to you i will never be in a bicycle race during a major negotiation never never but how about that dear and if you look i ran was a country that was in deep trouble they were doing badly and then we took the sanctions of we should have never taken the sanctions off before we finish the deal we took the sanctions off before you know why the great negotiations this and we will not negotiate unless you take the sanctions of and our guy said ok that's what they say and when they said that why didn't we say we want our prisoners back ok because our prisoners were there for years after that started like 10 1 trump the art of the deal right one on one we we we say ok and we took the sanctions if we got nothing for that they agreed to sit down they were dying they were choking and instead of saying we'll take the sanctions of but there's two things number one you got to release our prisoners right now number two we're not going to give you a hundred and fifty billion dollars back okay we're not giving up and they're going to say no way no way you know the great negotiator is the persians a great negotiator they're going to say no way in a million years no way then you leave she carry never got up and left right never got up and left then you leave and by the time you get back to the united states don't even get off the plane is going to turn around to go back you'll have your prisoners and you won't have to pay the 150 billion back so said because i'm all for making deals i think it's great you know to make deals with nuclear is a good thing not a bad thing but you gotta make good deals this is a deal that is ruinous to israel in my opinion i think this deal is a disaster a disaster for us but it's a disaster and even a bigger disaster for israel so we're gonna have great deals bank we're gonna make smart heels if you think about it so you had a ran which was chokin which had no i mean they were literally going to bust up i mean they were at a point where they were going to remember the riots and then obama gave the regime solace and they just took care of those riots so easily there was a time when they could have all changed could have all changed so instead we have a power a real power that's fighting us how about we make a deal there in yemen were fighting them in yemen we make a deal but we don't make a deal we don't talk about yemen and when asked about why we didn't discuss yemen because we're fighting i ran on the other side right we're going to like this well why didn't you put that into the deal and kerry said it was too complicated what's complicated what's complicated will give it all the stuff away and they'll have nuclear weapons they could buy nuclear weapons with the money they have they become a real power and now they're on the side of assad and you know that whole debate will have to talk about because you know i disagree with a lot of the things that a lot of people have been saying about the middle eastern about what we're doing you know is very interesting we spend tremendous tremendous tremendous amounts of money protecting other nations that are very very wealthy japan germany saudi arabia south korea we spend my in south korea we have 28 thousand soldiers on the line between them in the mad men right with 28,000 every time he acts up we start sending our ships or planes or boats are the you know you turn on one of those ships of course you two million dollars i just i would say don't turn on the engine save the money don't don't please the captain says sir would you like to hear the engine i'd say it was me i said no no just save the money relax the engines fine but it's true it's true i mean that's what they are is a different thinking right a lot of business people and it's a different thinking there's so much waste there's so much fraud there's so much abuse so we spend all of this money and i don't want to see them armed ideally i don't want to see them but you always have to be prepared to walk like carrie should have walked with her and he should have walk and then he should have said double up the sanctions and believe me you'll be back there within two days alright and most of that's flying time now that's what he should but you have to be prepared to walk he never walked okay so he never won so what happened with caring and what happens with all of us is we have the wrong people we have the greatest negotiators in the world anywhere in there with the greatest negotiators but we don't use that we use political hacks so with germany with japan with saudi arabia which is nothing but money if we weren't protecting saudi arabia if turkey are you from turkey sir good congratulations i actually have a very nice job in turkey saying please mention turkey ok i think his friend are you friend or follow huh i think he's friend but goats true turkey and i do we have investments inter cavett investments a lot of different places but i will tell you and turkey by the way should be fighting isis i hope to see turkey go out and fight isis because isis has in a certain sense taking very serious advantage of turkey they've taken advantage and turkey has a tremendously powerful military and they could white prices out by themselves i would love to see that how well would we love to see that because it looks like it was isis that did all the damage in the airport that was turkey so i think turkey is all of a sudden go to change and say that's enough for this and turkey has the power to do it and have the power to do it all by themselves they could do it they could do it pretty swiftly to so with all of these countries we pay for the military big portions big portions disproportionately so i said we have to get them to pass and i have a very good plan i was right on nato you know when i first gave my when they asked me about nato and i first said my statement is obsolete and they don't cover terrorism like they should and on top of that the countries of nato aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying it was on television everybody smiled haha that's so funny funny like we're a joke funny in about four days later they said you know trip was sort of right you have these people that study nato but they're so close to it is so totally closer they can't see the forest for the trees does that make sense so about four days later they said you know i said they toast oppositely and they don't study they don't have terrorism the way it should have never even had the right countries for terrorism actually but they don't have terrorism is a big thing and we're paying for so much and a lot of these countries aren't paying with this supposed to be paying many of them so we're protecting all these countries are not even paying us what this supposed to be paying and that's too little so i made that statement and i'm telling you for three or four days it was like donald trump doesn't know i'm not saying i'm an expert in there what i never nobody ever has to be about nato before but i have a lot of common sense and have a lot of business that built this great company i built an unbelievable company i have business sense so three or four days later all of a sudden they start saying you know what trump's your said makes a lot of sense t now they so two weeks ago i pick up the wall street journal and then the front page of the wall street journal headline nato to develop new unit for terrorism what i told and then it announced one of the top people in the world it is nate all right but one of the top people to be put in charge ok i said that's what i said now my name was mentioned in the bottom they said donald trump complaint oh great any complaint i said nato is is obsolete because of it that didn't mean a band and they tested me anything either fix what you have to develop something having to do with terrorism but it's absolutely we have a different world today that we had 40 years ago and sixty years ago we have a different world even the soviet union is now russia but let's say russia's damn strong so leave it for that but you know what two different world and i see things that a lot of people don't i said take the oil should i also said don't go into iraq - big mistake you can destabilize the middle east they went in but i also said don't go out the way we went out we just went out president obama announced we're gonna be out by a certain date the only thing deceptive about that was the enemy said nobody would have said so i don't think they believed him and then the date happened table we left and you know this all led to the formation of isis and lots of other things but i said when you go out take the oil right how long have i been sent a few years and you know what television to say before i did that they say what is your plan what is a plan i said i don't want to really say because i have a really good chance of being elected i don't want to talk about you know general patton didn't see it on television and say let's see you in july sixteenth we're going to attack isis from behind where they gonna knock out a battalion over here and we're going to drop so many bombs at this quadrant and we're gonna get here is my plan and by the way everything you ever notice everything we do it's always hard because we always have to say so i say to the television people i don't really tell you i was under riley the other night i should feel i don't want to really talk about it believe me i know what i'm gonna do when i knocked the hell out of isis i don't want to really too much talk about it but here's the problem you got to get elected so you got to talk about it's a little defective you gotta get elected so you got to talk about it so i said i'd go in with nato and i big data do something and i go in and it also get all of the countries around there that are really involved and have to be involved and i go and you gotta clean it up because these people are chopping off heads they're drowning people we're not allowed to waterboard right we can't work they're allowed to chop off heads they're allowed to drown people i said the other day when they go home and they're together and they just chapter 50 heads around 200 people and then they say in the united states that allow waterboarding they think we are so stupid they think we are so weak they have no respect for us whatsoever and remember this the only thing they understand is strength they don't understand kindness they don't understand political correctness the only thing they understand is strength and toughness and we are weak we're weak and hillary is weak as you get hillary is a weak person she's a weak person they will not understand hillary they want her to get in so bad the last person they want to see become president of the united states believe me is donald trump i can tell you that it's alaska they have dreams at night and their dreams are that hillary clinton becomes president of our country believe me so we need to show toughness we need to show strength we have to level the playing field we don't have a level playing field we don't fight to win anymore we don't win anymore we don't win with the economy we got china ripping us off we have japan ripping us off we have mexico beating us at the border beating us on trade taking all of our companies i mean they're taking tremendous numbers of companies unbelievable i think one of the reasons i want indiana is that the air conditioning company carrier announced they were leaving they're going to fire 1,400 people who went to my my speeches they were they were all over the place every time i said so who's here from carrier all these hands would be raised 1,400 people fired viciously and stupidly because carrier was moving and they're from indianapolis carrie was moving to mexico i think it had a huge because i won remember that was going to be the firewall for the other people that were running against me and it was a firewall for me i one with a landslide right now having bobby knight helped a lot but i will tell you they in new york and new ink england and everyplace pennsylvania big league we have our company's leaving so that happens we're going to stop that we're going to stop that cold and we're going to be so strong and will there be so smart and we're going to start winning again we're going to start winning like we have never won before we don't want any more as a country we don't win for our vets we're going to take care of our vets by the way we don't win for our vets we don't win for anything we don't win for a pride we don't win anymore and it's going to stop we're going to be victorious in so many different ways as an example common core we're bringing our education back locally we're getting rid of common core we're getting rid of common we're going to bring our education local our education system is a mess and a big reason is gone so we're gonna start winning again folks with a win with our military we're going to win four of its we're gonna win with education we're going to win with healthcare we're going to win big big big with trade we're not going to have these deficits of five hundred billion dollars a year losses we have with china 505 billion dollars a year they laugh at us and everyone talks about free trade i was asked the other day i was said they said well what's your and i know free trade so much i know ok they said well what's your definition what do you like i said i like trade well we make great deals for the united states that's what i'm that's my definite that's my definition of trick i know every form of trade i know every form of taxation we're gonna make great deals for the united states we have the greatest negotiators in the world we don't use we use political acts gonna make great deals for the united states so we're gonna bring our money back we're going to we right now ochina 1.8 trillion dollars we go japan 1.6 trillion dollars think of it japan sense as millions of cars and we owe them one point six trillion dollars you know what i call that a magic act in reverse it's like a magic so folks we're going to start winning again we're gonna win so much that the people of colorado i'm going to be sick of winning you're going to say oh i can't stand it this guy this president he wins too much we're not used to it we can't take it and your representatives and our great head of the republican party who is a great guy by the way and i thank you for introducing be i'm going to get calls in the white house mr. president please sir please we don't want to win this much we're winning

to thank you all i love your folks get out there get out there and vote we gotta get out there and vote and i want to thank you thank you everybody i love you folks thank you very much thank you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ensure is the next president of the united states of america yeah thank you everybody the honor is a great honor great state i have a lot of property a lot of people in virginia pay a lot of checks being every night every day a lot of great success i've had in virginia over the years and we have just phenomenal stuff in loudoun county as you know and we have down in charlottesville and some other stuff tremendous tremendous beautiful property charlottesville is right next to thomas jefferson who was an architect you know he had great taste he had great taste he understood that some of the most beautiful and i've ever seen so i love virginia and we are going to win virginia we're gonna win i'm going to go over some of the statistics when tim kaine was governor they're not pretty not pretty but before i do i just want to say that debbie wasserman shows yeah i always knew she was highly overrated i only hope not good but she just got fired and said debbie you're fired get out there be out boom boy they were how about that for disloyalty though in terms of hillary clinton in all fairness because debbie wasserman schultz has been so much for hillary clinton and has brought this by these politicians folks other than mike pence of course he's great but these politicians hella luck so this is a loyalty there right there is no loyalty none whatsoever it gets a little heat and they fire get out of here get out of here first she knew what was going on hillary clinton knew what was going on she knew everything that was going on she knew it's a rigged system that bernie sanders never had a chance ok he never had a chance and if you look at it look what's going on there having a lot of people marching now a lot of those people that vote for us i'll tell you right now a lot of them and not even because they like me or they don't like me although i have to see if you see the polls it just came out from right we had like the biggest bounce that anyone can remember they said well if he gets out of the convention with no bounce that will be a success do we have nine points or something ten points well leading we're actually leading in the polls and the cnn paul was so good i may have to start liking them again when i don't know it could now they treated me unfairly but you know what's more important the pole but you know the big ball the big ball that's no separate that suppose we care about but look out this soil crooked hillary clinton was to somebody that put her life on the line i mean she what she did in order to take advantage of bernie sanders in all of the supporters debbie wasserman should what she did in order to make sure that the system the rig system stays intact and hilary gets it and then you see the emails can you imagine they talk about religion they talk about religion can you imagine if that was my id right now be on the front page of every newspaper would be horrible and they're trying to play it down well that wasn't so bad that wasn't open now but could you imagine seriously just such a different standard so here's the story is a story so debbie was totally loyal to hillary and hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take her more than five minutes to make that decision man i don't want her covering my back i'll tell you right now through extreme now the other thing i'm surprised that you know it's nice when you're not reading speeches isn't really because i can talk about current events and stuff happened ten minutes ago you know if you're reading speeches i see these guys i dealt with a lot of them i've actually been a very political person in my life i've always been on the other side but now for 14 months i've been doing this and i like this side in a certain way better because we can do things better they used to love me when i was just a contributor i'd get millions of dollars just i was a contributing now i know we're not i like this battle i like i like being not established with better but with bernie when you look at what happened the thing that surprises me most is how we folded he folded i thought it was really hanging out tough tough tough then they find these horrible emails talking about his religion and dizzy jewish and izzy an atheist at one and that's not going to play well and sir man that's rough and that's not as bad as some of the other ones and i said there's no way that bernie sanders shows up to make a speech there's no way that he can ever indoors crooked hillary clinton anymore right there's no way and today i see him trying to make the case and his own people are out there booing okay they're out there bone so it's pretty bad then i'll tell you hillary clinton i've been sent this for a long time and i got it from bernie sanders because he said she suffers from bad judgment right bad judgment she suffers from very bad judgment her instincts a bad they're no good her instincts are defective her instincts are defective but she's got she's low energy she actually is long should go home she'll take a nap before five hours and she'll come back no naps but trump no no i don't take that we don't have time we don't have time you ever see hillary where she comes out and she read a teleprompter for a little while ninja go home you know 0 for three four days then she comes back and then they used to i remember and i would put like three or four people really nice people in there sitting around a little table and everyone say well i'd like to ask you a question oh you're too tough this is what we have how do you think isis is going to be like yeah i i don't think so right i don't think so not going to be good now we have tough enemies out there we have tough mean vicious horrible horrible people he's a horrible horrible human beings we need toughness folks it's about time we need strength we need toughness we need smarts we need warmth we need compassion we need everything we need everything but we don't need somebody that goes on to take snaps we don't need naps but what did surprise me was that bernie was so soft on this i really i was amazed because i watch the speech you know we must vote for hillary clinton i mean the hatred he's got but why would he do that he looks better if he didn't do it to me hey what do i have to do with it i don't care whatever you want to do but could you imagine if what's taking place now with the democrats took place in cleveland and by the way i have to tell you cleveland an amazing job thank you all i owe thank you cleveland want a job i spoke to the police jeep calvin did a phenomenal job up there but what we had and the secret service working with the secret service what a job they did but cleveland is a beautiful place i mean really i was so happy we had no problems that we're trying to show i know they showed this one square was this big square and a few people that bring the cameras and plus you know really because they don't want to show all that beautiful grass of you know with no people on and and you know why i'll tell you why because people like our message people like our messages they really liked it and if you look at philadelphia i went to school in philadelphia i love philadelphia if you look at philadelphia what they're going through right now looks like a lot of people it's a hundred degrees in and speaking of that by the way i don't know you so did you know i went to the other room so you have a second room and then outside you have over a thousand people and it's a hundred and four degrees out don't think of it and the first time i ever did it i said let's go let's go to the second room first right that's the ante room but let's go cuz it's the overflow room i said so i went in there we surprised that we were nice but you know i would love these people but you know what i also like i have to do it later and outside we have a lot of people i thought we said let them in the fire department won't let him in because of a fire regulation which is very sad because they're outside it's it's we have speakers out there i think the speakers of burning up folks it is hot i wish to fire marshal where's the fire marshal is the rally and come on fire month if they could get in fire marshal you know you have doors that go right out to the outside i promise is nothing like you don't have a problem i feel badly we have those people we have people standing outside you can get a few more people inside if they could let him in so that's the way a builder we'll talk okay that's the way i feel good so you had the firing of the head of the dnc and that was a vicious firing a lot of things happen you had her firing hillary clinton's total disloyalty was at play it really was people don't say that they won't say that on and the media oh if i did something with rights can you imagine if i fired rights i wouldn't do that because rights has done such a great job rights previous what a job he has done and i always used to say for months now i've been saying i'll take rights over debbie and everyone's at all but deputies are super size it so his rights and then it turned out that debbie flamed out and she's gone but the disloyalty was incredible and i really mean that because honestly whether you like her or not she worked very hard to rig the system so that hillary got it's true right it's sure you know it's true she worked very very hard to rig the system little did you know that china russia one of our many many friends came in and a half the hell out of us can you imagine can you imagine what they're hacking i guarantee we'll find why did hillary get rid of her middle name huh hillary no but why did you get rid of it hillary rotten twin rotten hillary rodham clinton right maybe that's why is too close no no it's too close it's too close you think mike pence would say this i don't think so by the way did i do a good job with my pants ok him and his family what a high quality person you know you have to vet people right and we vetted mike and they came back at these are killers they came back with many pages on certain people ok many pages i who would like to read a book many many pages with mike they came back with like nothing he's like the most perfect human being this guy i said mike did you ever do anything wrong in your whole life no i don't think so he is where is he's the best guy that guy's correct i love this guy i love them i love but you know what i really like about mike so listen to this to me a very important thing is her bad judgment now whether you like kurt choice tim kaine nobody even knows who he is now he's done a terrible job for virginia i assumed they said all he picked her you know he got picked because of virginia's virginia is very important and i'm doing very well here hey hey i'm employing a lot of people here and they don't employ anybody i spent a lot of money in potomac falls sterling that area i mean i spent a lot of money we have great great things happening next year we have two senior pga championship coming thousands and thousands of people come into virginia and spend a lot of money thank you i love you to go but but just think of it so hillary clinton has almost a fifty percent of the people want a progressive okay we don't have to like that but that's okay that's where they are they want to give everything away and raise your taxes that's what happens no no she will have a tax rates by the way have the largest tax cut of anybody running for office republican or democrat ok but hillary clinton hillary clinton will have a tax cut that is not there it's going to be a tax cut x 20 in reverse like a rocket ship we have the biggest tax cut proposal i guess it'll last for years and we're gonna get it through at least we're gonna get most of it through i'll tell you what i'm trying to get all of it through but we have and its policy it's you know put out there that doesn't mean there's not a little negotiation because we're going to have to negotiate but we're going to have it go hillary clinton is gonna have one of the biggest taxes creases in the history of our country because what she's proposing you're gonna have to pay for a very simple very simple now maybe she'll you know after she gets her to burn to get rid of all the stuff that doesn't help you by the way but what she's proposing she needs to have a massive massive tax increase now nobody ever talks about that do you notice he never talks about who's going to pay for it now they're going to pay but just statistically she's going to need a very major tax cut but here's something to me that's very interesting fifty percent of that party is bernie sanders almost and they're very passionate and that's a much more passionate side her people they fall asleep okay they fall asleep there watching on with bernie's people they're really out there they say what you want about bernie sanders he got it on free trade he got it free trade now i'm gonna i'm totally on the free trade i believe in free trade you know they get it all wrong because they just don't say it properly but i want smart red i want i want to trade with other countries but i don't want to lose 500 billion dollars here with china thank you china we love you very much but we're not going to lose 500 billion dollars and i don't want to have a trade in balance with japan where they send as millions of cars and we sent them some beef and then they send it back right and then they we send some wheat we they said cars we said we'd sounds like we got to sit in a lot of we write the trade balances message and with mexico we have an unbelievably big train amount so they kill us at the border they kill us they're killing us at the border and we have one of the biggest trade imbalances and what happens what happens i'm not even including the drugs right the drugs are pouring across you know i won the state of new hampshire and i got very very friendly with the people in new hampshire i'll never forget them because that's an amazing group of people and i said what's your biggest problem is that heroin pouring across the southern border i said heroin new hampshire because you look at new hampshire so beautiful with the lakes and the little beautiful roads and the trees and the forest i say you don't heron i think you have he said mr. trump you have no idea is one of the worst areas for that it comes pouring across the southern what i said you know what if i win i'm going to sit i'm gonna fix that problem where i am going to fix that problem i'm gonna fix that problem and one of the ways i appreciate that you know i always like to say if i would because honestly life is a very strange thing and things and i don't want to be arrogant because i don't want to be accused by them of being arrogant so i'll say if but it better be when i'm going to be very angry you folks from virginia from virginia but the folks in new hampshire and you're having the same problems but they have a good for whatever reason disproportionately badly heroin is pouring across the border and it's going a lot of it's going all over the country by the way everybody's got the problem you buy it for less than a candy bar and our youth is being poisoned and plenty of other people but our youth is being poisoned by this stuff heroin heroin and what we're going to do thank you and what we're going to do is first of all the border patrol agents endorsement 16,500 they've never done back and their job is easier now without trump their job is easier without trump because you know right now they just and people go by and these are great people i got to know him very well the border patrol agents want to do their job it's a much tougher job probably a much more dangerous you up when you sell people and say sorry folks bomb go back but that's what dangerous and saying you know we can't do anything it's called stand back stand back and leave me alone let him walk right in how stupid we have stupid over ok so i spoke to them when they endorse me and i said so let me ask you a wall how important they said mr. trump it's very very important very and they know they now see i just saved a million dollars somebody else would go out and hire a consultant who knows nothing they come in from harvard they spent about a year at the border they learned nothing they then write this 2,000 page report that nobody worried they'll charge you 1 million dollars for the report and you have no idea what just happened as opposed to saying like i did with the border patrol is a wall good they said very good they actually is an interesting expression they said it's a vital tool to turn things around it was a very interesting expression that it's a great man they just said it's a vital tool mr. trump to turn things around especially the drug traffic because it's very tough and we can build that wall so easily and by the way mexico is going to pay for the wall you know just just because they're going to pay for the way and i got great we got great marks on the on the speech the other night and everyone did everybody did so great we had such that by the way after seven the republican national convention was such a tremendous success it was so great i mean we had a couple of people that i think probably destroyed their careers but who knows but but honestly though but honestly that was such an incredible success and look at what's going on in front of you that was such a beautiful deal the city of cleveland was great the law enforcement was unbelievable we had no riots we had no nothing it was unbelievable i'll never forget it as long as i live it was on being believable and and i made his speech and i have to tell you because i figured this would not because i could have i made a speech if i if i gave the gettysburg address is given as good as anybody could possibly get i figured you know you always get nakey always get not i got great reviews on this beach i got great reviews we got standing ovations some people said well the speech was a little long that's because we had 26 or 27 minutes of lake standing ovations we had applause and i had a great time doing it because i'm talking about something that i love we're in a movement folks this is a movement this is it just i love what we're doing together right i love i love what we're doing i love it and what really what i have to say is this so hillary clinton is bad judgment she shouldn't have picked this guy kristen because he is the exact opposite what all of the bernie people want now if he got two percent of the vote or five percent of the vote or twenty percent of the vote she's but you know what he almost beat her if the system was it gamed if the system was in game he would have been her we would have beaten her now now think of this so instead of picking somebody and you don't have to go with pocahontas you don't have to go that far who by the way who hasn't done anything she's the worst she is the worst senator of the usn you know she's got a fresh mouth other bet she's got nothing going she has got she has done nothing at the us senate but you don't have to pick her but you could've picked a liberal person and we understand it what we can live with it and you know she could have had a party unity instead they have thousands and thousands of people going crazy because she didn't pick somebody representative she didn't pick somebody representative what's going on let's let's go look again she's got bad judgment whether it's libya whether it's a benghazi whether it's at night with the calls with the cause everybody's going the only cause she answers is her friend calls she picked that one up but she doesn't pick up the calls to help she's got bad judgment bernie sanders said she's got bad judgment she's got bad judgment when it came to picking a vice presidential candidate for that side of the party yeah i actually just ask mike pence i said my do you think she's going to be forced to change because honestly now i wouldn't pick him i wouldn't pick him for a different reason you know why i would pick him so mike pence in indiana has done an unbelievable job a triple a bond rating so many different things job creation top and virtually every category right toward the top at the top listen to this during tim kaine's tenure as governor of virginia plus he's not very popular i thought that i would see paul saying is at eighty-five percent and trump is going to lose virginia i'm gonna eat people don't even like the guy and you learn and we'd weird little dude there i don't know what's going on with him during tim kaine's tenure as governor of virginia from 2006 - 2010 the unemployment rate of the state more than doubled so i immediately went back to my statistician i said listen do me a favor will you please check it came back he said hey maybe he's wrong but more than doubled this is your great governor right now governor mike pence cut unemployment rate from 8.4 percent to less than five percent quickly yeah since 2000 turn 13 indiana's god from thirty first in the nation for veterans unemployment to second and it's going to go to first ok veterans are blown during tim kaine that's the guy that bad judgment crooked hillary clinton bad judgment such badger we can't have another president with bad judge but we can't do it during tim kaine's tenure as governor the state of virginia lost sixty thousand manufacturing jobs now indiana gained thirty thousand now it's a different time and different everything he was you know is i'm not comparing they're not cause they'll say well one was here was that but i'll tell you if mike pence for me was running virginia with the great this guy did a lousy job you know why is the political hack that's why he's a political act look what he's done look what he's done he's always been in politics he likes politics he wants to be in politics always ok during tim kaine centers governor virginia it averaged almost no gdp growth and indiana as you know is doing great i mean think of it here's a beauty ok nobody is going to vote for tim kaine when you hear this one ok tim kaine and if i never heard of this guy but that's okay less than a week after tim kaine became governor of virginia one week he proposed a nearly four billion dollar tax increase four billion including a tax increase on people earning as little as seventeen thousand dollars here he tried to pass a transportation reform he failed where's mike pence a tremendous like i mean the whole thing is ridiculous so a four billion dollar tax increases first week do we want this is the president now you know like hopefully we're not too worried about it i will say this virginia has lost one and three manufacturing jobs since built let these are my status stations are great signed the agreement to put china into the world trade organization don't forget he did that but bill clinton signed something that was the worst trade bill ever the history of this country ok in the history of this country after that was built that people don't realize i'll tell you a little joke see how hot it is everyone everyone sweating and soaking wet right here's the difference i would pay the hotel bill i'd say we're in a hotel we're in a ballroom and you know what that these are growing companies we're in a ballroom and we're in a ballroom it's not supposed to be so hot that everybody in the audience is using as a fan so what they do is they turn the air conditioning down because they save money so then i would not pay them and you know what i do i pay my bills so fast with somebody good with somebody average ape am ok with somebody great a lot of times they give bonuses but here we are in a ballroom and i'm like i feel like him i'm in a sauna ok right right so i don't know what hotel this is what you want to try turning on the air conditioning we're not going to get your pay these people is it am i right hot but just so you know i'm really good at this business you make a lot more money if you want a hotel and you let people suffer and don't turn on the air conditioning you make a lot more money you would be surprised at how much it cause but this is ridiculous and so then they'll be an article donald trump refuses to pay the bill good and you know what the smart people say trump is smart the other people would say always in that terrible okay i think the ballroom and the people that on this hotel should be ashamed of himself that so look block so virginia lost one and three manufacturing jobs since the bill clinton bill hillary supported chinese entry into the wto roanoke which is a beautiful place by the way has lost one and i've been here many times as long as one in three manufacturing jobs ok since the clinton disasters last year the us trade deficit with tpp countries i mean i could go into this i could read this stuff he gets a little boring after all but it's all the same thing we have hillary clinton wanted to approve tp that's trans-pacific partnership and then i announce that i'm against it and then she heard me making his face this is what i've heard a friend of mine told me and i basically said the various reasons including monetary manipulation currency manipulation etc why it's so good why it will be another nasty but maybe even worse can't be worse but it'll be his bed ok different countries but it will be has been and she heard me and she said oh he'll kill me under debate so what happened is she all of a sudden came out against tpp but as sure as you're sitting there she's going to approve tps you one she will approve it will make a change she'll make a comment you say move that come on now i can do it okay folks 6,000 pages of material that most people haven't read it is a disaster trans-pacific partnership is a disaster you can't let it happen we will never let it happen i will never ever let him and i don't want to make deals with many countries i want to do one-on-one deals one on one you got to see this deal it's like a fancy jigsaw puzzle lines going here here they're so one of the country misty haze you can't do anything it's just locked up into this very complex again i believe me it's just like obamacare thousands of pages and nobody in congress read it and now it's a disaster and we will repeal it and replace it with something fabulous okay all right but but we're going to have something that's going to be very special and i have to tell you i appreciate your being here and i really wish i appreciate it thank you thank you thank you thank you and i appreciate the folks in the room next door which is almost as big as this and it's packed also and even more than you folks i appreciate the people standing outside a hundred for their dying there dying although i venture to say that they're more comfortable that i am right now it's probably i think it's actually cooler outside that it is in this damn ballroom ridiculous yeah yeah predict but you know what i i'll tell you know what i love looking at the rover's back you know what i love and the other rows back what i love nobody left not one person i was watching doors i seed or solid open people pouring out i usually stop but that never happens with me never ever but what i stop nobody lives because you know what we're in this together we're in this together this is a movement so time magazine just another cover i talk about it you saw the one from the back of my head right it's pretty full back to you know could be could be better could be better but not been but a picture from the back of my head the guy was standing right off of me with a camera like this i studied that picture very close i didn't read the story but i did study the picture no i think that's number five or six that we've had so i think i've had two in my lifetime and five or six in the last few months where you know we had this incredible thing going on and they call it a movement and bill o'reilly calls in a movie he's never seen anything like he said in his professional career in his own lifetime he actually said this is the single greatest political phenomenon that has ever witness and britt you himself and a lot of people and i really mean is it's not about me it's about you there's there i'm a messenger there's a group of people in this country that's massive you know they used to call it a silent majority i don't use the term it's a noisy majority because we've had it we've had it with the iran deal we've had it with are depleted military we've had it with no borders we've had it with education where were ranked right near the bottom we're doing horribly we've had it where they want to essentially abolish your second amendment you have no protection for yourself we have and by the way the nra endorsed me and they're great people one hundred percent and the evangelicals how many evangelicals do we have in here you better get out and vote because you didn't vote for romney and you better get out and vote for me you know we have the johnson amendment where lyndon johnson who is very powerful put in a member we basically are pastors are ministers and all religions they don't have the right to speak up that i had i had a meeting i was telling franklin graham was a great guy i was telling jerry falwell jr is a great guy great guy i mean so many we had a meeting what we had 50 to 60 pastors ministers and they were saying we love you and they were praying and it was like this incredible scene and i said okay well folks can you endorse me what we can't do that why because we'll lose our tax exempt stance i said why now nobody brought this up to me they were living with it nobody was going to go find it i said why do you lose your tax exempt status what we're not allowed to speak and i said wait and i looked into it i said whoa and that was passed by the ultimate politician lyndon johnson i mean it's not like we're dealing with the pope this was lyndon johnson smart tough guy but we're smarter and tougher but look that was passed by a politician because he had problems with some of the churches in texas where they were going after him for good reason and i said wait a minute folks and we put in our platform that we're going to work like hell to get rid of the johnson amendment because because your representatives ministers and pastors rabbis they have totally lost their voice and don't kid yourself that's what's happening to religion in this country because you see the same numbers that i see so i think this if you're evangelical of your christian of your jewish if you have religion you better go out and vote for trump because this is going to be the last chance you ever get to get this thinking okay so thank you thank you thank you and i said in my i will say this i will say this i said in my speech the other night and i meant it i thank the evangelicals because i want i got these tremendous votes they say trump care twin south carolina right i said why because i have this tremendous crab i one with evangelicals i want all over with evangelicals because they get it they're smart they understand they know i'm not perfect i'm not perfect but they know i love them and they know i'm going to fight for him better than somebody that is perfect ok i'm going to fight for and i'm going to fight for other religions i'm going to fight i'm going to fight for people to be able to speak and actually when they said this to me i was in an office building very high up and i'm looking down and i said to these powerful pastors and these powerful men and women it's just powerful people with tremendous strength and energy and conviction and they're so when they're in the roman it was beautiful the voices and i said but that means that you are less powerful than those people walking down the street i pointed to the street because they have a right to talk and you don't you don't have your right to talk ok and that's our religion that's our religion in my case i'm presbyterian i'm protestant but but that's our religion and my minister who are like a lot doesn't have the right to speak we're going to end that folks you have one chance would have it so you better go back to your churches and you better get everybody to vote because for years ago they didn't get up and they didn't vote for romney and to this day a lot of people don't understand some people to understand frankly but you better get up and you better vote because if you vote if you think about it the if you take christian jewish take some of the catholic take the religions it's bigger than men and it's bigger than women right speaker than men you know man of fifty percent women of fifty percent the religious like what eighty percent right if you get up and vote we're going to get rid of that and we're going to free up great people to go and speak what they want to speak about and they should be able to speak ok very important so just a couple of things and i i i'd like to bring my cup i just a couple of things we are going to strengthen our military military is really depleted is not good i didn't want to go into iraq we got there i said keep the oil they didn't keep the oil these people don't know what they're doing you know the old days you're in a war to the victor belongs the spoils right today we get nothing trillions of dollars and caused thousands and thousands of

safer frost we're going to work one thing we have to do for the youth and it's a question i get asked mike more than any of the question we have young fantastic people going to college and they're choking on their debt ok they're choking on debt they haven't started life yet and some of them have given up before they start because they see no way we're going to work on a plan and we're working on it now so that we can help young people get through college and not diverge i mean some of these kids what they're doing is incredible you there the massive depression that's going on because they

trades and coming out of college and i want to probably another one yes go ahead thank you have to come for being here in virginia and i apologize for the heat are we going to have a question for you

question for you mr. trump now when you are in office oh what will be the timeline for that wall that you're talking jake that wall will go up so fast and be so big and powerful and as good looking as we can make it that your head will spin ok believe me it's going to go up fast thank you hmm next question go ahead how about over here go ahead check congratulations i have a small business and roanoke and upholstery shop what are you going to do for how to make america wealthy again have to do it with 30 miles from steel city pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation the legacy of pennsylvania steel workers lives in the bridges railways and skyscrapers that make up our great american landscape but our work is loyalty was repaid you know it better than anybody with total be trails are politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization moving our jobs our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very very wealthy i used to be one of them hate to say it but i used to be one but it's left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache when subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets threatening our factories the politicians have proven folks have proven they do nothing for years they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression level unemployment many of these areas have still never recovered and never will unless i become president then they're going to recover fast our politicians took away from the people there means of making a living and supporting their families skilled crafts and trades people and factory workers have seen the jobs they love shipped thousands and thousands of miles away many pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state of total disrepair this wave of globalization has wiped out totally totally our middle class it doesn't have to be this way we can turn it around and we can turn it around fast but if we're going to deliver real change we are going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pursued by powerful corporations media elites and political dynasties the people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything and say anything to keep things exactly the way they are the people who rigged the system are supporting hillary clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing's going to change the inner cities will remain poor the factories will remain closed the borders will remain open the special interest will remain firmly in control hillary clinton and her friends and global finance want to scare american to thinking small and they want to scare american people out of voting for the better future and you have a great future folks you have a great future these people have given her tens of millions of dollars my campaign has the absolute opposite message i want you to imagine a much better life and a life where you can believe in the american dream again right now you can't do that yeah i want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who let us from one financial and foreign policy disaster to another our friends in britain recently voted to take back control of their economy politics and borders i was on the right side of that issue as you know with the people i was there i said it was going to happen i felt it while hilary has always stood with the elites and both she and president obama predicted that one and many others totally wrong now it's time for the american people to take back their future gonna take it back that's the choice we face we can either give into hillary clinton's campaign fear or we can choose to believe again in america very sadly we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country america became the world's dominant economy by becoming the world's dominant producer you know that from right here right in this plant the wealth is created we shared broadly creating the biggest middle class the world has ever known but then america changed his policy from promoting development in america in in in america to promoting development in other nations that's what's happening and that's what's happened we allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods devalue their currencies violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable and our politicians did nothing about it trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs float overseas as a result i have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years today we import nearly 800 billion more in goods then we export can't continue to do that this is not some natural disaster it's a political and politician made disaster very simple and it can be corrected and we can correct it fast what we have people with the right thinking right up here it is the consequence it is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over americanism this is a direct affront to our founding fathers to america wanted to be strong they wanted this country to be strong and they wanted to be independent and they wanted it to be free our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians believe me george washington said that the promotion of domestic manufacturing will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government alexander hamilton spoke frequently of the expediency of encouraging manufacturing in in in the united states yeah and listen to this the first republican president abraham lincoln warned that whoa the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government will produce want and ruin among our people he understood it much better than our current politicians that's why he was abraham lincoln i guess our original constitution did not even have an income tax instead it had terrorist emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production yet today 240 years after the revolution we've turned things completely upside down we tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death and then we allow foreign countries that sheep to export their goods to us tax free how stupid is this how can it happen how stupid is this as a result we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before ladies and gentlemen it's time to declare our economic independence once again that means that means voting for donald trump yeah i'll do it no doubt about it not even a little doubt it also means reversing two of the worst legacies of the clinton years america has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 even as the country has increased his population think of this by 50 million people at the center of this catastrophe are to trade deals pushed by bill and hillary clinton first the north american free trade agreement or the disaster called napa second china's entry into the world trade organization nafta was the worst trade deal in the history it's like the history of this country and china's entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest job theft in the history of our country it was built clinton whose side nafta people don't remember in 1993 and hillary clinton who supported it and the havoc that it reached after he left office was on believable it was also built clinton who lobbied for china's disastrous entry into the world trade organization and hillary clinton who backed that terrible terrible agreement then as secretary of state hillary clinton stood by idly while china she did on its currency added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits and stall hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property yeah and i've been talking about china for many years and you know what nobody listened but they're listening now that i can tell you the city of pittsburgh and the state of pennsylvania have lost one third of their manufacturing jobs since the clintons put china into the wto fifty thousand factories across america have shut their doors in that time and this factory because of your great owners gave and gloria it's hanging in hanging in but they just told me it's not easy almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is a result and it's the result of trade with china it was also hillary clinton as secretary of state who shoved us into a job-killing deal with south korea as reported by the economic policy institute in may this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 american jobs as bernie sanders said hillary clinton loaded for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions millions of jobs trade reform and the negotiation of great trade deals is the quickest way to bring our jobs back to our country to understand why trade reform creates jobs and it creates a lot of them we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product from nineteen forty-seven to 2001 a span of over five decades our inflation adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of three point five percent however since 2002 the year after we fully opened our markets to chinese imports that gdp growth rate has been cut in half what does this mean for americans not good for every one percent of gdp growth we failed to generate any given year we also failed to create over 1 million jobs what a waste and what it said said thank you yeah americas job creation deficit due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs and that's just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put america back to work at decent wages wages are very low because there is no competition and they're going to go up because we're going to thrive again as a country the trans-pacific partnership is the greatest danger yet the tpp as it's known would be the death blow for american manufacturing it would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own it would further open our markets too aggressive currency cheaters cheaters that's what they are cheaters they're not playing by the rules that cheating it would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into united states markets while allowing foreign countries to continue putting up barriers in front of our exports which is what they do it's very hard to export to their countries they make it very difficult we on the other hand come on in everybody come on it that leadership the tpp would lower tariffs and foreign cars while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep american cars from being sold overseas that's not all mark my words china will enter the tpp through the back door at a later date they are watching they are studying the knot in it now but they're going to be in it if it's good i'll be there by the way it's no good they'll pass same way always is the agreement would also force american workers to come it directly against workers from vietnam one of the lowest wage countries on earth not only will the tpp undermine our economy but it will undermine our independence that's what's happening the tpp creates a new international commission that makes decisions the american people are no longer given the right to veto these commissions are grateful hillary's wall street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes it should be no surprise then that hillary clinton according to bloomberg took a leading part in drafting the trans-pacific partnership please remember that especially in november she praised the push the tpp on forty five separate occasions and even called it the gold standard hillary clinton was totally for the tpp just a short while ago but when she saw my stance which is totally against she was shamed into saying she would be against it too and i will tell you it was the same shame that she had recently where she was sort of forced into saying radical islamic terrorism which he didn't want to say but she was shamed into that but have no doubt that she will immediately approve it if it's put before her and that is guaranteed guaranteed you will do this justice she's betrayed american workers for wall street and throughout throughout her career her whole career she has betrayed the american worker she's trying to put on a good front now she will betray you again her career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never ever forget napa just never ever forget it because you know what is done and i know what is done and in touring i've seen the devastation that it's left behind here's how it would go she would make a small token change declared the tpp packed fixed and ram it through and you will suffer that's why hillary is now only saying she has problems with tp in its current form you know that means that means like they'll make a little too word change and she'll fix it and she'll feel great but she says in its current form she can rush to embrace it again and she will at the earliest opportunity if the media doesn't believe me i have a challenge for you and hillier as calorie if she's willing to withdraw from the tpp her first day in office and unconditionally roll out his passage in any form yeah there is no way to fix tp we need bilateral trade is we do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down like tp does a trump administration will change our failed trade policies and i mean quickly thank you here are seven steps i would pursue right away to bring back our jobs number one i am going to withdraw the united states from the trans-pacific partnership which has not yet been ratified i'm going to a point that toughest and smartest and i know mall trade negotiators to fight on behalf of american workers i'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a far in country is currently using to harm you the american worker i will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses and abuse is the right word number 4 i'm going to tell our national partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot not just a little by a lot for our workers and if they don't agree to a renegotiation which they might not because they're so used to having their own way not with trump they won't have their own way then i will submit under article 2205 of the nafta agreement that america intends to withdraw from the deal number 5 i'm going to instruct my treasury secretary to label china a currency manipulator which should have been done years ago any country that he values their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the united states which is many countries will be met with sharpening and that includes tariffs and taxes number 6 i'm going to instruct the us trade representative to bring trade cases against china both in this country and at the w do shine is unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the wto and i intend to enforce those rules and regulations and basically i intend to enforce the agreements for all countries including china seven if china does not stop it's illegal activities including its step of american trade secrets i will use every lawful present they look this is very easy this is so easy i want to love saying this i would use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with section 2 a 1 and 30 one of the trade act of 1974 and section 232 of the trade expansion act of nineteen sixty-two and when they say trade expansion they're talking about other countries they're not talking about us because there is no expansion they get the expansion we get the joblessness that's the way it works not going to happen anymore president reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened us industry i remember his tariffs on japanese motorcycles was forty-five percent and his tara to shield america's semiconductor industry was one hundred percent and that had a big impact folks a big impact hillary clinton and her campaign of fear will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war already have a trade work and we're losing badly badly she hasn't completely backwards hillary clinton on the least a trade war against the american worker when she supported one terrible deal after another from nafta to china to south korea it doesn't matter no matter where she went the american worker was hurt and you will be heard worse than ever before if she becomes president of the united states that i can tell you yeah a trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the american people and the american worker the era of economic surrender will finally be over will be over you're not going to see it anymore hello i can't guarantee it because after me they'll probably start doing it again but we will have four and maybe eight great great great productive years and will never go back and we'll make thank you thank you very much thank you thank you very much everyone appreciates a new era of prosperity will finally begin america will be independent once more independent once more doesn't that sound great under a trump presidency the american worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them we will stand up to trade cheating cheating cheater that's what they are cheaters we will stand up to trade chi anywhere and everywhere it threatens the american job we will make america the best place in the world to start a business will hire workers and will open factories and we'll get rid of these horrible regulations that make it impossible to do business in this country this will also include massive tax reform to lift the crushing burden on american workers and businesses we will also get rid of all of these rules and all of these problems and all of the bureaucracy which are destroying absolutely destroying our job creation capacity which we used to be the best in the world and now we're getting close to the bottom folks were getting close to the bottom many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest tax nations in the world we're also going to fully captured america's tremendous energy capacity this will create for our workers and that's what we want for our workers growth for our economy and begin reducing our budget deficits which are massive yearly budget deficits massive trade deficits we only want to talk about it our budget deficits are message hillary clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines and she wants to shut down and she said it just recently she wants to shut down the miners i want to do exactly the opposite yeah a trump administration will also ensure that we start using american steel for american yeah just like the american steel from pennsylvania to build the empire state though that's what going to do it built the empire state building it will be american steel that will fortify america's crumbling bridges american seal it will be american steel it will be american steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring soaring into the sky beautiful sight more beautiful with american steel it will be american steel that rebuild our inner cities it will be american hand that we make this country and it will be american energy minds from american resources that powers this country it will be american workers who are hired to do the job nobody else american workers we are going to put american steel and aluminum back in to the backbone of our country this alone will create massive numbers of jobs high paying jobs good jobs not the jobs we have today which everybody agrees are bad jobs we're going to create massive numbers of good jobs on trade on immigration on foreign policy we are going to put america first again we are going to make america wealthy again we are going to reject hillary clinton's policy of fear and her policy of of absolute nonsense because it's not working and it's grossly incompetent and we can't take it any longer and we're not going to take it any longer we are going to embrace the possibilities of change but real change not obama change real change it's time to believe in the future it's time to believe in each other it's time to believe in america again this is how we are going to make america great again for all americans for all americans we're going to make america great again for everyone greater than ever before and i promise you if i become president we're going to be working again we're going to have great jobs again you're going to be so happy you can be proud of your president you're going to be proud proud proud of our country once again thank you very much i appreciate it thank you thank you very much i appreciated win then we even expected all five and that's something that's not only is it all it's all five whether it's sixty or just about sixty and even as she went up there at 66 and 67 and you have to remember and i say this all the time to the pundits i love the pundits fine i said all the time there are three people when you crack 60 and as we did last week with our great city and our great state of new york when you crack sixty with three people that's very hard to do in fact i think chris can tell you correction she would do people that's gone that's called a massive landslide but we have three and you know some strange things have happened last night it was very strange when i watched this group get-together was a strange moment i got a call at eleven o'clock and we talked and i said i think that's a good thing because it shows weakness it shows ineffectiveness it shows failing camp it's collusion in business they put you in jail for collision in politics you're allowed to get away with it but it really is it say i thought it was a very weak signal and the republican party needs something much different than they will be going to thank you will be going going to indiana be leaving tomorrow afternoon were just a long stay and it's a great state of many many friends there and i have a coach bobby knight the great bobby knight and we're going to be spending a lot of time with bobby he's an amazing guy he's tough be sharp be smart and he wins he knows how to win and the people of indiana love him and bobby's endorse me and we're going to spend tomorrow night and i think the next day with bobby so it's going to be a lot of excitement and tron and that's called the gold standard for indiana i would say bobby knight has to be the gold standard and we have so many other people that have endorses do so that'll be great so we'll be spending well short of the afternoon and will be spending number stays in indiana and it's going to be something really really special so i want to thank the media the media's really covered me very rare for the last two hours they've been the last few weeks and you know it's been amazing what's been happening the crowds we've had a record-setting grounds bigger than bernie but pretty shocked and i have to say in fact i suggested today you probably saw that the democrats have treated me very badly and frankly i think he should run as an independent ok i actually actually i think they've treated very badly and you know the system is a bad system and whether it's this system our system you look at what goes on but you know the best way to beat the system is heavy things like this where you get record-setting votes will you get record-setting delegates i used the analogy of the boxers boxer knocked out the other box you have to wait around for a decision so that's what it is and that's what happened tonight that's what happened last week in new york and that's really what's been happening throughout we have millions more votes millions more then cruise we have millions more votes than kasich kay'-sik now i guess it was 141 so now he's won and 46 why is he here i can tell you that if you look dr ben carson did much better he could have hung around and done very well if you look chris christie did much better if you look marco rubio much back marco rubio right now has more delegates than you know i mean he's got more delegates but so many others i mean that actually done all they do is hang around but they said it was inappropriate and a lot of people don't like seeing it is like a spoiled person that just as i'm just staying for whatever reason cell kasich and by the way soon as casey gets hit with the first negative ad he's had none being that's the end of that you know it's the only thing you can say and today we came up even against hillary but we will be hillary so easily and you know remember i was not going to run according to everybody and i ran i was not going to sign for may which basically you sign your life away and i signed for me and then everybody says saying wow and then we put in financials the financials were phenomenal sharpen a little bit like this evening try better than even people thought great financials i built a great company with the help of my my sons and my daughters and i mean with the help of my family but we don't get great great company and that was and then everybody said again he just gonna have a good time for a couple of weeks she's enjoying it and very shortly we went to number one over three or four week period and we've been there ever since we've been number one ever since and again millions of more votes hundreds of more delegates and i think this one is maybe the biggest of them all and in new york last week at almost sixty-two percent was incredible far better than what people thought they said if you can break fifty again with three people is very hard to break 50 we're almost sixty-two percent picked up some mango last week we had last week we had 95 delegates in new york state new york city the whole thing added up to 95 we picked up almost every single one of them it was an amazing victory but this one's a diverse menu go rhode island and you go maryland and you go connecticut and you go pennsylvania and you go i mean the whole thing delaware and every one of them was conclusive and every state is so different so different i think one of the greats wars when you look at almost 50% in massachusetts and almost 50% in the state of alabama now that's pretty different but we have all across the board and i think we're gonna do really well in washington state i think we're gonna do amazingly well in oregon and every place we're going to i mean we're gonna be going fighting hard new mexico we're gonna be fighting really hard and i think that governor kasich and senator crews have really really hurt themselves with a faulty deal that was defaulted on before they even started because kasich said well what are they going to vote for me and indiana well i said i thought they just made that deal so what it is is politicians all talk no action they can't get it done and they certainly can't straighten out our country because we're gonna bring back jobs were gonna take care of our military we're gonna be doing so especially over the last two weeks because i traveled new york state and i went to syracuse and tipsy and wrong this room our room rome new york as opposed to another room out there someplace but we went to rome new york and we went to the island that's page and and just every place we went manufacturing down 40 and 45 percent and even more and then we go to pennsylvania we see the same thing you look at what's happening with stealing you look at what's happening and so many other industries and i get statisticians to give me numbers and before i leave all the time give me the numbers and every single place i go is a disaster manufacturing down 40 45 50 55 60 percent sometimes in a relatively short period of time our jobs are being sucked away from our country and we're not going to let that happen more trucks were gonna make it very very difficult to do that and when companies want to leave this country our great country and they want to lay off all of these people that in many cases helped build the country there will be consequences for that company to pay when they think they're gonna make their product and send it in no taxes to a very weak for which by the way of what it will be very very strong and we will build the law just remember i said but when when they think they're gonna send their product right through this week border and they're gonna pay no tax and have absolutely no consequence for what they did is not going to happen that way and you know what's going to happen when we do that all of a sudden companies are going to say i'm staying in syracuse and i'm staying in pennsylvania and i'm staying and maryland and i want to thank the people of maryland have been so incredible we had some rallies all off we had some rallies in maryland and pennsylvania that were absolutely unbelievable yesterday in pennsylvania we were in an arena that was like madison square garden they turned away thousands and thousands of people unfortunately the press every day we show my face they go like this i said does anybody ever gonna show this arena that's got tens of thousands of people in it but they don't do that but that's ok because i'll at least explain it to you but we're going to have our country back to make america great again and i just want to tell you for the five states i am so honored this was to me our biggest guide the christian and will most likely yes i consider myself we will have him here's hoping well let me i dont wanna see you with pennsylvania you know we had a massive victory 60% above 60% pennsylvania has been amazing we get seventy we got 17 delegates out and then you have fifty four or so delegates that are you know up for grabs the one thing different with pennsylvania not been hearing about had heard about it for years actually is that the winner of pennsylvania has a moral obligation at least on the first round to support the person that one now waitin on a wintry one big and again we have to get in mind you have the three people and when you have three people to get 60% that's almost unheard of honestly if you have two people and you got sixty percent that's a really big victory so here you have a case where we have a great leader great republican leader and you have a moral obligation in pennsylvania that those people will end all i care about is the pressure on you know when you people write about cruises going around giving people dinner by people everything riding around all over the place getting them into hotel rooms because she's looking for the second and the third and the fourth i'm not really too interested in that because the first i'm not looking to go second third fourth fifth maybe i'm making a mistake i mean the truth is even if this did ever go there can you imagine if donald trump is in california up to almost 50% that we hit 50 today and there at 18 and 16 i mean there's a massive difference would have a big californian i think we're gonna do great in indiana indiana is the home of carrier air conditioning which is leaving for mexico that i've been talking about for the last four months long before i knew indiana would be shown and i'm saying that won't happen if i'm president jerry will not be leaving india if i'm president and but i've been talking about this for a long period of time so when you think of it and the really unfair saying that the pundits never report when i began the process with seventeen people very capable people like chris governors senators dr ben carson very smart tough highly accomplished people seventeen a record in the history of politics seventeen people shall i go and i start winning and i'll win new hampshire and i'll get whatever it may be 32% and people said why did he get 50% said you can't get 50% when you have sixteen people then i go to south carolina we have a massive victory that was crews stronghold except i wanted in a landslide and i wanted because of the evangelicals who back me the evangelicals have been unbelievable and they back to me so i won there and we had twelve or thirteen or fourteen people have many many people and i got a lot and then we went to nevada we went to the south we went i mean alabama with all of the people we had we almost got 50% massachusetts with all of the people we had we almost got 50% the pundits i was watching tonight the pundits never talked about the fact that these early stage especially even now we have 33 is unfair you know hillary has 13 there's a big difference is a big difference between fighting one person fighting troopers and people in terms of percentage of self what i'm saying is when you talk about the 1237 number the first seventy percent of these things we had from sixteen people in heaven 17 people who can 28262 524 n out at three so it's really unfair when you try and i mean i'm always been very good or bad nobody ever discusses that when i watched the people on television whether it's cnn fox or any other and i watch they never talked about the fact that we have all these people and that if you got a 32 435 438 and you have seven people running that's an unbalanced like 75 so we are really honored by this night and i'm really honored to have hit over 60 in virtually every race with three people in the race ok i didn't want to bore you with that long but it's never discussed on television he's wasting his time to distract i heard he had a news conference tonight and i heard the news conference was for the purpose that he's getting out of the race that's what i thought and instead he just had a news conference more talking abut but no i don't even think about it right now i'm not doing that and whether to set up a committee at some point in the not too distant future but i just don't want to think about it i want it i want to finish it off well i think he's fantastic now i hear that president presidential he'll do that it's very easy to be presidential much much easier but i'm not playing a part 17 i'm down now i'm winning its over it is as far as i'm concerned it's over these two guys cannot win there's no path so why would i change you know if you have a football team and you're winning and then you get to the super bowl you don't change your quarterback rhett so i'm not changing i think we're gonna do great in the general i may act differently but my thought process is the same you know when i speak to a group of 10 people in a conference room i'm not going to be speaking the same way i spoke in pennsylvania yesterday to 25,000 people so very different thing but i'll be saying gruesomely think jessica i'm doing a foreign policy speeches which i look forward to well as an interesting question i had many many people right in sweden modern way of writing but right in sweden call-in please don't change please don't change just a the way you are so look i'm not changing you know i went to the best schools i am like a very smart person i'm gonna represent our country with dignity and very well but i dont wanna hear somebody said if you changed and if you were that way you wouldn't be maybe where you are right now you know we've been a lot of people a lot of people sitting back saying what happened darling why we sitting here watching television don't forget when i announced there were many favorites that we're going to win one of those people raised over a hundred million dollars in a pack and a lot of money personally others had other big advantages governors of major states etcetera etcetera they're all gonna do great they were great but one after another after another and here we stand with big five victories over 60% david i call a crooked hilary is crooked she'll be a horrible president she knows nothing about job creation her husband signed nafta which destroyed this country economically i will tell you you look at new york state you look all over new england you look at pennsylvania nafta was a disaster her husband signed it and it was a disaster for this country hillary will be horrible absolutely horrible on economic development she will be terrible on job she knows nothing about jobs except for jobs for self and when it came to answering the phone when i came to answering the phone at three o'clock in the morning she was sleeping ok she wasn't with benghazi and all of the other problems you look at what she did with syria you look at what she's done and so many different ways she will not be a good president she doesn't have the strength she doesn't have the stamina i know about dealing with china i've made billions of dollars dealing with china china can be dealt with and you can get along with him but hillary does not have the strength stamina to deal with china or other things but bottom line is one of the big problems our country has problems with trade will you have china japan mexico so many countries just ripping us left and right the politicians cannot handle that problem two reasons number one they don't have the competence to do it number two most of them are paid off through campaign contributions so that they don't touch certain things that the people want touch when people are making less money in real wages than they were 18 years ago and then some people say wow he had a big crowd that's one of the big reasons when you have people making less money today as you know as you see every stat less money today david then they made eighteen years ago and in some cases that working two jobs so they getting older and they're working harder shouldn't be that way no i don't worry about it no no i don't i'm not a hateful person i'm a person that loves people and make america great i'll do far more for women that hillary clinton will ever do remember this including protecting our country because she will not be good with a military she will not be good with protecting our country and she's had her shot and she also raised her hand when it came to iraq and she shouldn't have voted and if you remember just take a look at the things that bernie sanders was saying about hillary clinton she said she's not qualified he said she is not qualified to be president but he said something else that was disqualified was qualified man you gotta go you gotta run and you see what happens but he said some things about her that was so incredible incredible and so incredibly bad there's a great level of hatred right there but he's been telling the truth and i really mean it i think birdie center should run as an independent that take you do great i think the party to see me that way i'm getting calls that as i said you wouldn't believe i'm getting calls from people that i really can't even know how they can do it because they've said such horrible things about me and now they want to join the team chris continue that ben carson can tell you that other people can tell you that i'm getting calls corey can tell you paul can tell you what we have we getting calls from people were actually say how could you do this how can you do this how can you do it and they have no problem but just the fact is names that you wouldn't believe name did you interview and say all trump trump trump and now they're calling 21 they want to join the team a lot of them will be coming up soon they want to come out very soon yes tomorrow is going to be i think interesting it's gonna be some of my views on foreign policy and defense and lots of other things so we'll be discussing and and part of it is the economics i mean we always ask the question recently on air on cnn and he talked about nato i gave a great it so i gave an engine that a trick people didn't like it said you know what is right experts say i said it's obsolete and too many people are getting a free ride because we're funding 72 73 percent of nato of 28 countries and many of these countries are just taking advantage of the united states and you have to pay up because we don't have a country with 19 trillion in debt that can afford this anymore you have to pay up and part of what i'm saying is people we love our country so we love our allies but our allies can no longer be taken advantage of this country this isn't for two years ago and it's not twenty years ago this is now and we have to rebuild our infrastructure we have to rebuild our country we have to get rid of isis so we have to get rid of them trash our military is totally depleted we have to build it up it's going to be the cheapest thing we can do and a lot of great things are going to happen within make america great again not really hear different things never change one thing you know i will never change make america great again i want a child now it's not gonna be the drugged up and you know when i say it won't be the trumped-up because in life you have to be flexible you have to have flexibility you have to change you know you may say one thing and then the following year you want to change it because circumstances are different and i have followed people so years and i have friends that are the most successful people in the world many of them are endorsing the carl icahn many the great business people are enjoying something you have to have flexibility you can say this is my doctor and i will not move because the world changes countries change leaders change lots of things happened so you can't say that ok yesterday we don't have a ceiling we know what our ceiling as i think it's a hundred percent we don't have a cell and again the ceiling was always so unfair because i just do it again because i wanted to it because its own foot but this year they're stealing they kept saying he doesn't hit the fifty percent without it on said that in what but how do you get 50% when you have sixteen people in a race you can't do it now you don't understand i have many people running i think im gonna win new york no other republican can say i think i'm gonna win gives me i conservative voters do you see the polls where they're coming out tonight the most conservative people in the republican party tonight back donald trump the mostest getting student debt and wanted to work on that we're gonna make it much effort the biggest problem the students have to have the problem with debt but they go to a good college they borrow right up right up to here and there joking on debt and they graduate they work hard to get good box and then they can't get a job i'm gonna bring jobs back to well we have a lot of contrasts in terms of jobs we have a lot of contrasts in terms of how i would handle wall street look hillary clinton is funded by wall street folks she's going to get the nomination unless she gets herself indicted with respect to what's happening with the emails ok you know what i don't understand you look at what's happened to so many other people and there you know they went through hell their lives have been destroyed for doing less than what hillary clinton did what she did is an outrage it's an absolute criminal outrage and for her to be able to run as a democrat that's why maybe bernie sanders is a isn't finished but the only way you can say that is if something happens to her she's being protected by the democrats because what she did and i see it and whether i read about in the papers are i watch it with experts legal experts on television virtually every single one of them said what she did is a criminal act and what she did is a very very dangerous thing for our country and yet here she is running for president so i think that hillary honestly shes a florida candidate and i think she's going to be easy to beat i think she's going to be much easier debate than most of the sixteen people that i competed security threat to the united states is no clear that's our biggest threat it's our biggest risk the power of weaponry and we have to be unbelievably careful the single biggest it is not global warming president obama said the biggest threat to our country's global warming that's cool give me a break ok the biggest threat to our country is no clear and we cannot let iran get a nuclear weapon we're gonna do shopping will have a real partnership with china you know we have a lot of power over china china has rebuilt itself by making a fortune over china has power tremendous power over north korea we have to be very vigilant on north korea we cannot let this guy go much further and china should handle that problem china can handle that from very easily that they say they can't but they're touring with us ok did toying with us we have a lot of time we have a great relationship with god we have a great relationship with putin and russia but let me tell you china has a lot of power over north korea a tremendous amount of power they just refused to use it and they refused to talk about it and they're talking with us and right now they don't respect us they don't respect our president and because of that they're getting away with murder and this guy is getting away with murder what's going to happen is something very important to me and to a lot of other people but very very important to me is nuclear weaponry that is you single biggest threat in the ok i saw the cable stations and networks and i read it in a lot of pictures i've had 55,000 negative it's against me when i ran in flyer i had 14,000 negative its millions and millions of dollars and i wanted a landslide i had negative ads all throughout and i won races in a landslide get a landslide you know what you reported you all reported i'm not even car would agree to that right i mean landslides and yet i have this tremendous amount of the youngest two ads industry pretty much to do but i had now largely the address false little truth or some of them perhaps but largely at 55,000 a hundred million and even more negative it's even in new hampshire i mean jab spent millions and millions of dollars of negative ads and i won new hampshire unless i dunno but now what's happening is most of these people that have been driving me are gone and when i'm one-on-one with hillary she will be as i said easier to take down much easier to beat then the people many of the people that have already be ok well i think they're hurting the party because again they have no path 0 path to victory and with a win on the first ballot we don't look for the delegates on number two three four five ballot and here's what i say let's just assume it did go beyond the first balanced and let's assume you're right she's a very good man had a rnc orange previous and let's say oh well trouble is 12 short or fifteen delegates or 25 sure but 500 more than crews and far more than that had a fashion show you go to a second ballot now trump by that time will be five million votes because of california the size of california and i think indiana and other places drop by that time will be five million votes ahead of crews will be much more than five million drugs education kasich should be get she gonna get i called him one now changing now change it to 146 i mean how do you stand around and i would have won ohio had i not been given a dirty poll saying that i florida was tougher than i thought i stayed in florida for two more days instead of going to have i spent two more days in ohio ok how do you pick a man on the second or third or fourth ballot who has millions of votes 56 million votes less than trump and i'm the one that brought all these people into the party that's why the republican party is up almost seventy percent from four years ago and those people at a minimum gonna be very upset very hungry but they're not gonna vote so how do you do this how do you say ok truck one by side million votes trump is 56 whatever hundred delegates more than crews and much more than that having to do with case and he brought millions of people into the party and everybody is talking about the party worldwide how hot the republican party in some people used to save stayed well the democrats are 35 percent down from four years ago the republicans are almost 70 percent up from four years ago so that's an amazing and that's not because you don't believe me that's that's because of how do you say to them we're going to choose a man that lost by five million votes and 500 delegates were gonna take him because trump was fourteen delegates short of winning the first batch i don't think you can do that with that being said i intend to get enough delegates but that's ok yes when one more question i'll stick with my feelings on immigration if you look at what's going on immigration and just look at the record numbers of people right now that are pouring across the borders of this country they're pouring excuse me i just read it and i read it and actually a legitimate journal we need protection in our country you look at the kind of crime you look at what's going on economically we need borders and by the way i want people to come into a country but i want him to come in legally that to come she has is the woman she's got nothing else going and frankly if hillary clinton where a man i don't think she'll get five percent of the vote the only thing she's got going and the beautiful thing is women don't like her ok ok ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel i'm a newcomer to politics but not to back in the jewish state in 2001 weeks after the attacks on new york city and on washington and frankly the attacks on all of us attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalist mayor rudy giuliani visitors israel to show solidarity with terror victims i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel one hundred percent in spring of 2004 at the height of the violence in the gaza strip i was the grand marshal of the 40 is salute to israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel many people turned down this honor i did not i took the risk and i'm glad idea what i didn't come here tonight to pander to you about israel that's what politicians do all talk no action believe me i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally are unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother the only democracy in the middle east the state of israel thank you my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous thank you thank you i have been in business a long time i know deal making and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for america for israel and for the whole of the middle east the problem here is fundamental we have rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return i'd studied this issue in great detail i would say actually greater by far than anybody else believe me all believe me and it's a bad deal the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it because already you know as you know it has the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock and of course they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them the deal doesn't even require a ran to dismantle its military nuclear capability yes it places limits on its military nuclear program for all the a certain number of years but when those restrictions expire iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad iran's behavior is terrible terrible situation that we are all placed in an especially israel when i'm president i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to around first we will stand up to iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region iran is a very big problem and will continue to be but if i'm not elected president i know how to deal with trouble and believe me that's why i'm going to be elected president folks yeah and we are leading in every poll remember that place iran is the problem in iraq a problem in syria a problem in lebanon a problem in yemen and will be a very very major problem for saudi arabia literally every day iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states hizbollah lebanon received and i'll tell you what it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons anti-aircraft weapons and gps systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have now they're in syria tried to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights in gaza iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad and in the west bank they're openly offering palestinians seven thousand dollars for terror attack and thirty thousand dollars for every palestinian terrorists home that's been destroyed a deplorable deplorable situation yeah iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror secondly we will totally dismantle iran's global terror network which is big and powerful but not powerful like us yeah iran is seated terror groups all over the world during the last five years iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents they've got terrorist cells everywhere including in the western hemisphere very close to home iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach believe me believe me third at the very least we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract and force before folks believe me iran has already since the deal is in place test fired ballistic missiles three times those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states and we're not going to let that happen we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to israel believe me yeah thank you you want to hear something really shocking as many of the great people in this room know painted on those missiles in both hebrew and far soon where the words israel must be wiped off the face of the earth you can forget that yeah what kind of demented minds right that in hebrew and here's another you talk about twisted here's another twisted part testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made the deal is silent on test missiles but those tests to violate the united nations security council resolutions the problem is no one has done anything about it ok which brings me to my next point the utter weakness and in the united nations is not a friend of democracy it's not a friend to freedom it's not a friend even to the united states of america where as you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to israel with president obama in his final year yeah he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel believe bank well every and you know it and you know it better than anybody so with the president and his final year discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine let me be clear an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto which i will use as president one hundred percent when people ask why it's because that's not how you make a deal deals are made when parties come together they come to a table and they negotiate each side let's give up something its values i mean we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires that's what a deal is a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine we bring together a group of people that come up with something that's not going to happen with the united nations it will only further very importantly it will only further d legitimatize israel it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel it's not going to happen folks yeah and further it would reward palestinian terrorism because every day they're stabbing israelis and even americans just last week american taylor al enforce a west point grad phenomenal young person who served in iraq and afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding palestinian you don't reward behavior like that you can not do it there's only one way you treat that kind of behavior you have to confront it so it's not up to the united nations to pollute to really go with the solution it's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves they have no choice they have to do it themselves or will never hold up anyway the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling israel that it must be and and really that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to israel to anything in the area it's so preposterous we're not when i'm president believe me i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state it will be vetoed one hundred percent you see i know about deal-making that's what i do i wrote the art of the deal one of the best-selling all time and i mean seriously i'm saying what up because i'll be criticized azure i say thee so i'm going to be very diplomatic one of i'll be criticized i think it is number one but why take a chance one of the all-time best-selling books about deals and deal-making to make a great deal you need to willing participants we know israel is willing to deal israel has been trying right israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years you had camp david in two thousand where prime minister brock made an incredible offer maybe even too generous arafat rejected in 2008 prime minister own merit made an equally generous offer the palestinian authority rejected it also then john kerry tried to come up with afraid work and a bus didn't even respond not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america they didn't even respond when i become president the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one yeah thank you and when i say something i mean it i mean i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately i have known him for many years and will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region meanwhile every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and to hate the jews it has to stop when you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes little kids want to be firefighters when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars other heroes little kids want to be athletes and movie stars in palestinian society the heroes are those who murder juice we can't let this continue we can't let this happen any longer you you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs glorifying terrorist is a tremendous barrier to piece it is a horrible horrible way to think it's a barrier that can't be broken that will end and it led soon believe me in palestinian textbooks and mosques you've got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace they've got to go out and they've got to start this educational process they have to end education of hatred they have to end it and now there is no moral equivalency israel does not name public squares after terrorists israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians you see what president obama gets wrong about deal-making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our and you see that happening all the time that pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former secretary of state hillary clinton who is a total disaster by the way she and president obama have treated israel very very better but it's repeated itself over and over again and has done nothing to emboldened those who hate america we saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community it didn't happen president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue but it is precisely the opposite that happens already half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half so it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the united states will get it solved one way or the other we will get it soft but when the united states says with israel the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially that's what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally this state of israel the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely totally unbreakable they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel they must do that and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a i love the people in this room i love israel i love israel i've been with israel so long in terms of i've received some of my greatest honors from israel my father before me incredible my daughter ivanka is about to in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i'm concerned so i want to thank you very much it has been a truly great honor thank you everybody thank you thank you very much
