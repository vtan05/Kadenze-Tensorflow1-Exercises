# Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This repository contains assignments for the Kadenze Course: Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow I

Session 1: Introduction to Tensorflow  
- Teaches how to preprocess your data and apply convolution to different kernels  
- Dataset used for this session was from Caltech 101  

Session 2: Training a Network w/ Tensorflow
- Teaches how to create a deep neural network  
- Discusses the different parameters in Tensorflow (ex. Optimizations, Cost Functions, Activation Functions, etc.)  
- Apply creative thinking in using neural networks in images
- Dataset used for this session was from Caltech 101
